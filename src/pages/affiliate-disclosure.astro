    <h1>Affiliate Disclosure</h1>

    <p>
      Building Products Info is committed to providing independent, accurate product information
      for the UK building and trade industry. To help fund this work, some of the links on our
      site are affiliate links.
    </p>

    <h2>What Are Affiliate Links?</h2>
    <p>
      Affiliate links are special tracking links provided by retailers and merchants. When you
      click one of these links and make a purchase, we may earn a small commission. This comes
      at <strong>no additional cost to you</strong> — the price you pay is exactly the same whether
      you use our link or go directly to the retailer.
    </p>

    <h2>How This Affects Our Content</h2>
    <p>
      Our product information is compiled independently. The presence of affiliate links does
      not influence which products we feature, the specifications we list, or the information
      we present. We aim to cover products based on their relevance to trade professionals
      and DIYers, regardless of whether an affiliate programme is available.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Identify Affiliate Links</h2>
    <p>
      Affiliate links on this site are clearly marked. Buttons such as "Check Price" or
      "View at Retailer" are affiliate links and carry the appropriate <code>rel="sponsored"</code>
      attribute. These links will always open in a new tab and direct you to the relevant
      retailer's website.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We will always disclose when affiliate links are present on a page.</li>
      <li>Affiliate relationships do not influence our product information or editorial decisions.</li>
      <li>We only link to reputable retailers.</li>
      <li>If a product does not have an affiliate link available, we still include it if it's relevant.</li>
    </ul>
