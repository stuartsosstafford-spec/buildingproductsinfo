draft: false
faq:
  - question: "What order should I paint a room in?"
    answer: "The professional order is: ceilings first, then walls, then woodwork (frames, skirting, architraves). Within woodwork, do window frames first, then door frames, then skirting boards. This sequence minimises the risk of drips and brush marks on finished surfaces."
  - question: "How long should I wait between coats of emulsion?"
    answer: "Most trade emulsions are recoatable in 2-4 hours in normal conditions (well-ventilated room, 15-25°C). In cold or damp conditions, allow longer. Check the product data sheet — rushing recoat times causes the second coat to lift or drag the first."
  - question: "Do I need to sugar soap walls before painting?"
    answer: "Yes, especially in kitchens, hallways, and any room that has been lived in. Sugar soap removes grease, nicotine residue, and surface contaminants that prevent paint adhesion. Mix sugar soap powder with warm water and wash down walls and ceilings before sanding and priming."

## Painting a Room to a Professional Standard

The difference between a paint job that looks tired within a year and one that holds up for five or more is almost never the paint itself — it is the preparation and the sequence of work. Professional decorators spend the majority of their time preparing surfaces. The finish coat is the last fifteen percent of the job. This guide takes you through every stage in the correct order, from washing down to the final topcoat.

## Preparation: Washing, Filling, and Sanding

### Washing Down

Before any other work begins, every surface to be painted must be washed. Grease, cooking residue, nicotine, and polish all prevent paint from adhering properly, and no amount of additional coats will compensate for a contaminated substrate.

[Mangers Sugar Soap Powder](/building-materials/mangers-sugar-soap-powder/) mixed with warm water is the standard wash-down product used across the trade. It cuts through grease and wax without leaving a residue that would itself cause adhesion problems. Work from the bottom of the wall upwards to avoid dirty streaks running down clean surfaces, then rinse with clean water and allow the surface to dry fully before moving on. In kitchens and rooms with any history of smoking, this step is not optional — skipping it is the single most common cause of a fresh coat of paint looking dull or peeling within months.

### Filling and Patching

Once surfaces are clean and dry, attend to all cracks, holes, and dents. Use a flexible filler for hairline cracks in plaster and a setting-type compound for larger voids. [Knauf Fill & Finish Jointing Compound](/building-materials/knauf-fill-and-finish-jointing-compound/) works well for feathering out shallow dings and plasterboard joint repairs — it is lightweight, shrinks very little on drying, and sands back easily without clogging abrasive paper. Apply in thin coats rather than one heavy application, allowing each coat to dry before applying the next.

### Sanding

Once filler is fully dry, sand all repaired areas flush with the surrounding surface using 120 grit followed by 180 grit, finishing by hand to avoid creating hollows with a power sander. Sand the entire wall surface lightly with a fine-grit sanding pad if the existing paint is in poor condition or has a sheen that may resist a new coat. Wipe down all sanded surfaces with a damp cloth or tack cloth to remove dust before priming.

## Priming and Stain Blocking

This is the step most often cut short, and the one that causes the most callbacks.

### When to Use a Primer

New plaster must always be mist-coated before any trade emulsion is applied. Dilute your emulsion approximately 20% with water and apply a thin coat — this seals the surface and prevents the topcoat from being absorbed too rapidly and drying out before it has levelled, which leads to cracking and patchy coverage. Do not skip this on fresh or recently repaired plaster.

For surfaces that have been previously painted and are in sound condition, a full primer is not always necessary. However, any bare patches, filled areas, or newly plastered spots must be spot-primed before the finish coat, or you will see flashing — visible variations in sheen where the paint has dried at different rates.

### Shellac-Based and Multi-Surface Primers

[Zinsser Bulls Eye 1-2-3 Primer](/building-materials/zinsser-bulls-eye-123-primer/) is a water-based primer that bonds to almost any surface without sanding — including previously painted gloss, tiles, bare metal, and new plaster. It dries in under an hour and provides a consistent, sealed base that evens out the porosity of mixed substrates. On a room that has been heavily patched, or where you are painting over a previously glossed surface with an emulsion finish, a full coat of Bulls Eye 1-2-3 across the whole surface is money well spent.

### Stain Blocking

Water stains, nicotine, fire damage, and certain marker inks will bleed through standard primer and emulsion regardless of how many coats are applied. The solution is a dedicated stain block applied to the specific area before general priming begins.

[Polycell Stain Stop Aerosol](/building-materials/polycell-stain-stop-aerosol/) is a shellac-based aerosol that can be applied precisely to stained patches. Spray the affected area, allow to dry for twenty minutes, and then apply your general primer over the top as normal. Without this step, stains will continue to bleed through indefinitely.

## Choosing the Right Paint

### Matt vs Wipeable Finishes

The choice of finish should be driven by the room's use, not personal preference alone.

For living rooms and bedrooms where walls will not take hard wear, a standard trade matt emulsion is the correct specification. [Dulux Trade Diamond Matt Paint 5L](/building-materials/dulux-trade-diamond-matt-5l/) offers exceptional coverage — typically around 17 square metres per litre — and a robust film that resists scuffing and light marks without the visible sheen of a vinyl matt. It is more expensive per litre than a budget emulsion but covers more area per coat, which narrows the cost difference considerably.

For rooms where walls need to be wiped down — kitchens, bathrooms, children's rooms, hallways, and stairwells — specify a washable matt rather than a standard emulsion. [Crown Trade Clean Extreme Matt](/building-materials/crown-trade-clean-extreme-matt/) is formulated specifically to withstand repeated cleaning with a damp cloth without the finish breaking down or burnishing. Standard trade matt emulsions will begin to look patchy and worn at wipe-down points within months in high-traffic areas.

For lower-budget projects or large areas such as rental properties where speed and coverage take priority over ultimate durability, [Leyland Trade Contract Matt Emulsion 10L](/building-materials/leyland-trade-contract-matt-emulsion-10l/) and [Johnstone's One Coat Matt Emulsion](/building-materials/johnstones-one-coat-matt-emulsion/) both offer competitive coverage at a lower cost per litre. These products are better suited to areas that are less susceptible to hard wear.

### Paint Quantity

Calculate area by multiplying wall height by perimeter length, then subtract window and door openings. Divide by the stated coverage rate on the tin — always use the lower end of the stated range rather than the upper, as real-world coverage is almost always lower than the theoretical figure, particularly on textured or porous surfaces. Allow for two coats as standard; a single coat of any emulsion on a previously painted surface is rarely sufficient to provide an even, opaque finish.

## Masking Technique

Masking is not about taping everything in sight — it is about taping precisely where you need a clean edge and cutting in freehand everywhere else.

Tape is most useful at ceiling-to-wall junctions, along architraves and skirting boards, and around light switches and sockets. [FrogTape Multi-Surface Painters Tape](/fixings-adhesives/frogtape-multi-surface-painters-tape/) uses a PaintBlock technology along its edge that seals against capillary bleed — the mechanism by which paint wicks under standard masking tape and produces a ragged line. Press the tape firmly along its entire length with a dry finger or a plastic spatula before painting. Remove the tape at a 45-degree angle while the paint is still slightly wet, never after it has fully hardened, to avoid pulling the paint film with the tape.

For larger areas — masking floor edges, window boards, or covering furniture and floors — [tesa Professional Masking Tape 50mm](/fixings-adhesives/tesa-professional-masking-tape-50mm/) provides a wider coverage strip and consistent adhesion across a range of surface temperatures. Refer to the maximum application time stated on the packaging; in warm rooms or direct sunlight, adhesive transfer can occur if tape is left significantly beyond the stated limit.

## Exterior Painting

Exterior masonry requires a different product range and a different approach to preparation.

Wash all external walls thoroughly to remove moss, lichen, mould, and dirt. Use a dilute fungicidal wash and allow adequate dwell time before rinsing. Any areas of powdery or friable render must be treated with a stabilising solution and allowed to dry fully before painting. Fill cracks in render with a suitable external filler, and re-point any open masonry joints before painting over them.

[Sandtex Ultra Smooth Masonry Paint](/building-materials/sandtex-ultra-smooth-masonry-paint/) is a flexible, microseal formulation that bridges hairline cracks and resists both water ingress and mould growth — properties that matter considerably in the UK climate. Apply two full coats; a single coat on exterior masonry provides insufficient film build to achieve the stated performance. Do not apply in rain, fog, or when frost is forecast within 24 hours of application.

For exterior timber such as fencing and outbuildings, [Ronseal Fence Life Plus 5L](/building-materials/ronseal-fence-life-plus-5l/) is a water-based preservative stain that penetrates into the wood grain rather than forming a surface film that can crack and peel on rough-sawn timber. Apply with a wide brush or a paint pad in dry conditions, working the product well into any end grain.

## Order of Work

Following the correct sequence avoids painting over your own work and prevents contaminating finished surfaces.

Always work ceiling first, then walls, then woodwork last. On ceilings, cut in around the perimeter with a brush before rolling the main field — this prevents stippled roller texture from appearing in the cut-in band. On walls, cut in at ceiling junction, skirting, architraves, and corners before rolling. Roll in a random cross-hatch pattern rather than long vertical strokes to avoid tram lines and ensure even film build. Apply woodwork finishes — gloss, satin, or eggshell — only once all emulsion work is fully dry.

Allow a minimum of four hours between emulsion coats in normal conditions, longer in cold or humid rooms. Open windows where possible to aid ventilation and speed drying, but avoid direct draughts across wet paint which can cause uneven drying and surface defects.

## Summary

A professional-quality paint finish depends on taking preparation seriously, choosing the correct product for each surface and application, and working in the right order. Invest time in washing down, filling, and priming before the finish coat goes on — the material cost of good preparation products is small compared with the cost of remedying a paint job that fails early. On any room where durability matters, specify a trade emulsion rated for the conditions rather than defaulting to whatever is cheapest per litre.
