## Choosing the Right Building Materials

Whether you are doing a full extension, a loft conversion, or a straightforward renovation, picking the right materials from the outset saves rework, callbacks, and money. This guide covers the material categories that come up most often on UK construction and refurbishment projects — insulation, structural sheet materials, membranes, paints and primers, jointing compounds, and site preparation products.

## Insulation

Insulation choice is driven by three things: the U-value target you need to hit, the available depth, and the application (floor, wall, or roof).

**PIR rigid foam** boards are the most space-efficient option. A 75mm [Celotex GA4000 PIR Insulation Board](/building-materials/celotex-ga4000-insulation-board/) will outperform a much thicker slab of mineral wool for the same wall depth, making it the first choice for warm-roof flat roof build-ups, cavity closers, and insulated dry-lining. PIR is moisture-resistant and does not sag over time.

**Mineral wool** (glass or rock wool) is cheaper per square metre and handles irregular joist bays well, but it requires greater depth to achieve equivalent performance. It remains common in pitched roof installations and party wall situations where acoustic performance also matters.

Always check the product lambda value (thermal conductivity) rather than relying on thickness alone. A lower lambda figure means a thinner board can achieve the same result.

## Structural Sheet Materials

### OSB3

[OSB3 Sterling Board 2440x1220mm](/building-materials/osb3-sterling-board-2440x1220/) is the standard structural sheet for floors, roofing decks, wall bracing panels, and site hoarding. The "3" grade denotes suitability for use in humid conditions — a requirement for most external or semi-exposed applications under UK Building Regulations. It is considerably cheaper than plywood while delivering comparable structural performance for most load-bearing applications.

For flat roof decks, specify at least 18mm OSB3 and ensure all sheet edges are supported at joints. Stagger the board layout and leave a 2–3mm expansion gap around the perimeter.

## Membranes

### Breather Membranes

A breather membrane is fitted to the external face of a timber frame or behind rainscreen cladding. It keeps bulk water out while allowing water vapour to pass outwards — preventing interstitial condensation inside the wall build-up. The [DuPont Tyvek Supro Breather Membrane](/building-materials/tyvek-supro-breather-membrane/) is a well-regarded option with a high vapour permeability rating (low Sd value) suitable for most open-jointed or ventilated cladding systems.

Fix with stainless steel clout nails or plastic cap nails and lap horizontal courses a minimum of 150mm, with 150mm vertical laps around corners.

### Damp Proof Membranes

For ground floors, a [1200 Gauge Damp Proof Membrane](/building-materials/dpm-1200-gauge-damp-proof-membrane/) laid over the hardcore blinding protects the slab and any floor finish from rising ground moisture. 1200 gauge (300 micron) is the minimum required by most building inspectors. Lap joints by at least 300mm and tape them; turn the membrane up at the perimeter to link with the wall DPC.

## Trade Paints and Primers

### Interior Emulsions

The finish coat you specify should match the conditions in the room and the durability required by the client.

For living rooms and bedrooms, a standard trade matt such as [Leyland Trade Contract Matt Emulsion 10L](/building-materials/leyland-trade-contract-matt-emulsion-10l/) or [Johnstone's One Coat Matt Emulsion](/building-materials/johnstones-one-coat-matt-emulsion/) offers good coverage at a competitive price per litre. These products are formulated for speed of application rather than exceptional durability.

For kitchens, bathrooms, and high-traffic hallways, step up to a washable finish. [Crown Trade Clean Extreme Stain Resistant Matt](/building-materials/crown-trade-clean-extreme-matt/) and [Dulux Trade Diamond Matt Paint 5L](/building-materials/dulux-trade-diamond-matt-5l/) are both designed to withstand scrubbing without burnishing or breaking down — worth the extra cost in areas that will take hard wear.

### Primers and Stain Blockers

Priming correctly is the step most often skipped and the one that causes the most comebacks.

[Zinsser Bulls Eye 1-2-3 Primer](/building-materials/zinsser-bulls-eye-123-primer/) is a water-based shellac-substitute that bonds to virtually any surface without sanding — new plaster, previously painted woodwork, tiles, glass, and bare metal. It seals minor stains in a single coat and provides a consistent base for topcoats. For stubborn stains — nicotine, water damage marks, fire damage — use a [Polycell Stain Stop Aerosol](/building-materials/polycell-stain-stop-aerosol/) on the specific area before applying a full primer coat over the surface.

New plaster should be mist-coated (emulsion diluted 20% with water) before finishing. Skipping this step causes the topcoat to dry too quickly and crack.

### Exterior Coatings

For rendered or bare masonry exteriors, [Sandtex Ultra Smooth Masonry Paint](/building-materials/sandtex-ultra-smooth-masonry-paint/) provides a flexible, weather-resistant finish formulated to bridge hairline cracks and resist mould growth — important in the UK climate. Apply two full coats over a stabilising solution on any powdery or friable surfaces.

For exterior timber fencing, [Ronseal Fence Life Plus 5L](/building-materials/ronseal-fence-life-plus-5l/) is a water-based preservative stain that feeds into the wood grain rather than sitting on the surface, making it more durable than simple paint on rough-sawn timber. For masonry surfaces prone to water ingress — garden walls, copings, garage floors — [Everbuild 402 Water Seal 5L](/building-materials/everbuild-402-water-seal-5l/) provides an invisible silicone-based barrier with no effect on the finished appearance.

## Jointing and Filling Compounds

For skimmed plasterboard joints, [Knauf Fill & Finish Jointing Compound](/building-materials/knauf-fill-and-finish-jointing-compound/) is a lightweight, ready-mixed compound suited to tape and jointing systems. It sands easily, accepts direct decoration, and does not shrink significantly on drying — important when feathering out wide joints. Apply in two thin coats rather than one thick application to avoid cracking and reduce drying time.

For expanding foam around window and door frames, pipe penetrations, and roof openings, [Soudal Gun Grade Expanding Foam](/building-materials/soudal-gun-grade-expanding-foam/) gives controlled application and good adhesion to masonry, timber, and PVC. Use the gun-grade formulation rather than a straw can for any job larger than a small gap — the control it offers reduces waste considerably.

## Site Preparation Products

Good preparation determines how well everything else performs.

[Mangers Sugar Soap Powder](/building-materials/mangers-sugar-soap-powder/) mixed with warm water is the standard wash-down for walls and ceilings before repainting. It removes grease, nicotine residue, and any wax polish that would prevent adhesion. Do not skip this step on kitchens or heavily used rooms.

For setting fence posts, gate posts, and lightweight structural posts without mixing concrete, [Blue Circle Postcrete 20kg](/building-materials/blue-circle-postcrete-20kg/) is a rapid-setting dry-pour concrete that sets in around ten minutes. Pour the dry powder around the post, add water, and backfill — no mixer required. It is not a substitute for properly mixed concrete in structural applications, but it is significantly faster for standard fencing work.

For timber assembly and general woodworking, [Gorilla Wood Glue](/building-materials/gorilla-wood-glue/) provides a waterproof PVA-type bond with good open time for repositioning, and it sands without gumming up abrasives once cured.

## Summary

Specify materials to match the application, not simply to the lowest cost. The savings from using an underspecified product rarely outweigh the cost of remediation — particularly with insulation, membranes, and primers where a failure means uncovering finished work. When in doubt, check Building Regulations Approved Documents for minimum performance requirements and ask your merchant for the data sheet before substituting a specification.
