Whether you are just starting out or refreshing an ageing toolkit, having the right tools makes the difference between a clean, professional job and one that costs you time and reputation. Plumbing spans a wide range of tasks — from first-fix pipework in a new build to isolating and repairing a live system in an occupied home — and your toolkit needs to reflect that range. This guide works through the key categories, with recommendations for each.

## Pipe Cutting

Accurate, clean cuts are the foundation of good plumbing. Ragged or angled cuts lead to poor joint seating, leaks, and wasted fittings. A quality pipe cutter is therefore non-negotiable.

The [Rothenberger Pipeslice 15mm Copper Pipe Cutter](/plumbing-heating/rothenberger-pipeslice-15mm-copper-pipe-cutter) is a popular choice on the tools belt. Its slim-profile cutting wheel gets into tight spots that a conventional ratchet cutter cannot, and the auto-feed mechanism means you do not need to continuously adjust the clamping pressure as you rotate. For most domestic first and second fix in copper, a good 15mm cutter and a 22mm counterpart will cover the vast majority of work.

For plastic pipe, check the manufacturer's guidance on compatible cutters — some ratchet-style cutters leave a slight bevel that affects push-fit joint seating.

## Pipe Bending

Bending rather than fitting elbows keeps the system neater, reduces potential leak points, and looks more professional to any inspector or future plumber who opens a wall. A quality bender is an investment that pays back quickly.

The [Monument Masters XV Pipe Bender](/plumbing-heating/monument-masters-xv-pipe-bender) handles 15mm and 22mm copper with a guide wheel and former set that produces consistent, kink-free bends. It is a robust tool built to withstand daily trade use, and the correct former selection for each pipe diameter is straightforward. Spring benders are useful as a lightweight backup for occasional small-bore work, but for regular bending a proper bench bender is far more reliable.

## Wrenches and Grips

No plumber's bag is complete without a set of quality grips. The [Knipex Cobra 250mm Water Pump Pliers](/tools/knipex-cobra-250mm-water-pump-pliers) have become something of an industry standard for good reason. The push-button adjustment allows rapid jaw resizing without removing a hand from the tool, and the grip on chrome fittings, compression nuts, and service valves is exceptional. A set covering 180mm, 250mm, and 300mm sizes handles almost anything on a domestic or light commercial job.

Alongside pliers, carry at least one adjustable spanner in 250mm and 300mm sizes, and a pair of stillsons or a pipe wrench for larger-diameter pipework. Radiator valves and older compression fittings often need more torque than pliers alone can safely deliver.

A good [Stanley FatMax 8m Tape Measure](/tools/stanley-fatmax-tape-measure) should be clipped to your belt. Accurate measurement of pipe runs, offset bends, and fitting centres avoids wasted material and return trips to the van.

## Soldering Equipment

Capillary solder fittings remain common in older properties and are still specified on some commercial contracts. A decent blowtorch, flux, solder wire, and a fire-safe working surface are all required.

Heat damage to surrounding materials is a persistent risk when soldering in confined spaces. A [Rothenberger Plumber's Soldering Mat](/plumbing-heating/rothenberger-soldering-mat) provides a reusable, heat-resistant barrier between the flame and adjacent joinery, insulation, or structural elements. It is a small item that removes a significant liability. Keep a fire extinguisher accessible and never leave a freshly soldered joint unattended until you are satisfied any heat has dissipated.

## Push-Fit Fittings

Push-fit has become the dominant jointing method for much new domestic plumbing, and for good reason — it is fast, reliable when used correctly, and requires no heat or specialist tools beyond a pipe cutter and a deburring tool.

The [John Guest Speedfit 15mm Equal Elbow](/plumbing-heating/speedfit-15mm-push-fit-elbow) represents the Speedfit system, which is compatible with copper and plastic pipe and is widely accepted under Building Regulations for concealed installations. For copper pipe specifically, always insert a pipe insert (liner) to prevent the fitting's collet from deforming the pipe end under pressure. The [Yorkshire Tectite Sprint Push-Fit Coupling](/plumbing-heating/yorkshire-tectite-sprint-push-fit-coupling) is another dependable option, particularly where a permanent joint is preferred over a demountable one.

## Pipe Freezing

There are jobs where isolating via a stopcock is not possible — a faulty valve, a system without adequate isolation, or a section of pipe buried in a roof void with no convenient service point. A pipe freezing kit lets you create a temporary ice plug and work on a live system safely.

The [Rothenberger Rofrost Rapid Pipe Freezing Kit](/plumbing-heating/rothenberger-rofrost-rapid-pipe-freezing-kit) uses CO2 cartridges to freeze a section of pipe quickly and is suitable for copper and plastic pipe up to 28mm. Always confirm the pipe is not carrying gas before freezing, and follow the manufacturer's dwell times carefully — a partially frozen plug that gives way mid-joint is a serious problem.

## Testing and Commissioning

Once a system is complete, pressure testing and commissioning is not optional — it is a requirement under Part L and Part G of the Building Regulations for new and altered systems. A manometer is the correct tool for gas-tightness testing, and an accurate gauge is essential for water system pressure checks.

The [Arctic Hayes U-Flex Manometer Gauge](/plumbing-heating/arctic-hayes-u-flex-manometer) offers a clear digital readout and the flexibility needed to reach test points in awkward locations. Carry both a manometer and a mechanical pressure gauge as backup — digital instruments can fail or lose calibration, and you do not want to be on site without a working testing rig.

## Workwear and PPE

Working in confined spaces, under floors, and in loft voids puts considerable strain on joints and exposes you to dust and debris. Good PPE is not optional.

The [DeWalt Titanium S3 Safety Boots](/site-equipment-ppe/dewalt-titanium-safety-boots) combine steel toe protection with a composite midsole and are light enough for a full day on the tools without excessive fatigue. For floor-level work — fitting cylinders, working under baths, or running pipework under joists — the [DeWalt DWC15001 Professional Knee Pads](/site-equipment-ppe/dewalt-dwc15001-professional-knee-pads) provide gel cushioning with a hard-shell outer that protects against nail heads and rough concrete alike.

In low-light situations — which includes most loft spaces and many under-floor voids — a quality torch makes a real difference to the quality of your work and the time it takes. The [Makita DML186 18V LED Torch](/site-equipment-ppe/makita-dml186-led-torch) runs off the standard Makita LXT battery platform, puts out a strong, consistent beam, and can be stood upright or hung to illuminate a work area hands-free.

## Tool Storage

A well-organised bag means less time hunting for the right tool and a more professional impression on site. The [Stanley FatMax Technician Tool Bag](/site-equipment-ppe/stanley-fatmax-technician-tool-bag) offers a rigid base, multiple internal pockets for small items like olives, inserts, and flux tins, and external pockets for pliers and spanners. At the end of the day, tools that go back to the correct place are tools you can find at the start of the next job.

Invest in quality across the categories covered here and your toolkit will last years rather than seasons. Buy cheap on a core tool like a pipe cutter or bender and you will replace it — or worse, blame poor work on something that was the tool's fault, not yours.
