draft: false
faq:
  - question: "What PPE is mandatory on a UK construction site?"
    answer: "At minimum, a safety helmet (EN 397), safety boots (S1P or S3), high-visibility clothing (EN ISO 20471 Class 2 minimum), and eye protection (EN 166) are required on most UK construction sites. Ear protection is mandatory where noise exceeds 85 dB(A). Individual site rules may impose additional requirements."
  - question: "Do self-employed tradespeople need to provide their own PPE?"
    answer: "Yes. Under UK health and safety law, self-employed workers are responsible for providing their own appropriate PPE. When working on a site managed by a principal contractor, you must comply with that site's PPE requirements, which may exceed the legal minimum."
  - question: "How often should a first aid kit be checked on site?"
    answer: "First aid kits should be checked and restocked at least weekly on active construction sites. Designate a responsible person to maintain the kit. The HSE specifies minimum contents based on the number of workers on site — an empty or incomplete kit fails to meet legal requirements."

Getting site safety right from day one is not optional. Whether you are running a small domestic extension or a commercial fit-out, UK law places clear duties on those in control of construction work. Getting caught short — whether by an HSE inspector, an insurance auditor, or worse, an incident — is costly in every sense. This guide sets out the practical steps for getting a site compliant, with a focus on the PPE, first aid equipment, and access gear that tradespeople and small contractors actually need to source.

## The Legal Framework: CDM 2015 and HSE Requirements

The Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015 — known as CDM 2015 — are the primary legal framework governing health and safety on UK construction sites. They apply to virtually all construction work, including domestic projects where a contractor is employed.

Under CDM 2015, any project with more than one contractor must appoint a Principal Contractor, who takes responsibility for the construction phase health and safety plan. Even for single-contractor jobs, you are still legally required to manage foreseeable risks and ensure workers are protected.

Beyond CDM, the Personal Protective Equipment at Work Regulations 2022 (an update to the 1992 original) extended the duty to provide suitable PPE to all workers, including the self-employed. The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 remains the overarching duty of care legislation. Failing to comply with these is not a technicality — HSE has the power to issue Prohibition Notices, Improvement Notices, and pursue prosecutions carrying unlimited fines.

The practical upshot: you need documented risk assessments, a method statement for higher-risk tasks, and the right equipment on site before work starts.

## Head Protection

Head protection is one of the most visible indicators of a well-run site. Under the Personal Protective Equipment at Work Regulations, employers must provide suitable head protection where there is a risk of head injury from falling objects, striking fixed structures, or working at height.

Hard hats must meet EN 397 as a minimum. For sites with electrical hazards or where lateral impact is a risk, look for helmets rated to EN 50365 (electrical insulation) or EN 14052 (high-performance industrial helmets).

The [JSP EVO2 Vented Safety Helmet](/site-equipment-ppe/jsp-evo2-vented-safety-helmet/) is a well-regarded option for general construction use. It meets EN 397 and features a ratchet adjustment system that makes it genuinely wearable for a full working day — important for compliance, since workers are less likely to remove PPE that fits properly. Helmets should be inspected regularly and replaced after any significant impact, or at the manufacturer's recommended interval regardless.

## Foot Protection

Safety footwear is required wherever there is a risk of foot injury from falling objects, penetration by sharp objects, or slipping. For most construction environments, S3-rated boots — which include a steel or composite toecap, midsole penetration resistance, and a cleated outsole — are the appropriate standard under EN ISO 20345.

The [DeWalt Titanium S3 Safety Boots](/site-equipment-ppe/dewalt-titanium-safety-boots/) sit at a sensible mid-range price point and are commonly used across trades. They provide the S3 rating required for groundwork and general construction, along with the ankle support that matters on uneven ground.

## Eye and Ear Protection

### Eye Protection

Eye injuries account for a significant proportion of reportable construction site incidents. Grinding, cutting, drilling, and mixing all generate hazards requiring appropriate eye protection. Safety spectacles must meet EN 166 as a minimum; for higher-risk operations such as angle grinding, a face shield or goggles rated to EN 166:2F or above are needed.

The [Uvex Pheos Safety Spectacles](/site-equipment-ppe/uvex-pheos-safety-spectacles/) offer anti-scratch and anti-fog coatings that keep them usable in practical site conditions. Workers who cannot see clearly through fogged lenses will remove them — so spec quality matters as much as compliance rating.

### Ear Protection

Sustained noise exposure above 80 dB(A) triggers action under the Control of Noise at Work Regulations 2005. At 85 dB(A) and above, provision of hearing protection becomes mandatory. Most power tools and machinery on a busy site will exceed this threshold.

The [3M Peltor X4A Ear Defenders](/site-equipment-ppe/3m-peltor-x4a-ear-defenders/) offer an SNR of 33 dB, making them suitable for high-noise environments including breaker work and timber cutting. They meet EN 352-1 and are a standard specification on many commercial sites.

## Hi-Vis Requirements

Hi-vis clothing is required wherever workers are at risk from moving vehicles or plant. On any site with delivery vehicles, telehandlers, or road-adjacent work, this means EN ISO 20471 Class 2 as a minimum — typically a vest or jacket with fluorescent background material and retroreflective tape.

The [Portwest S476 Hi-Vis Executive Vest](/site-equipment-ppe/portwest-s476-hi-vis-executive-vest/) meets EN ISO 20471 Class 2 and provides a professional finish that is appropriate for client-facing site visits as well as day-to-day use.

## First Aid Provision

The Health and Safety (First Aid) Regulations 1981 require every employer to provide adequate first aid arrangements. For small sites, this means at minimum a suitably stocked first aid kit and an appointed person — someone trained to take charge in an emergency and call for help.

The [HSE Workplace First Aid Kit](/site-equipment-ppe/hse-workplace-first-aid-kit/) is stocked to the HSE's own recommended contents list for construction environments and provides a straightforward, compliant starting point. Kits should be stored accessibly, checked regularly, and restocked promptly after use. A sign indicating the kit location and the name of the appointed first aider is a basic but important requirement.

## Access Equipment

Falls from height remain the leading cause of fatalities on UK construction sites. The Work at Height Regulations 2005 require that work at height is properly planned, supervised, and carried out using appropriate equipment. Ladders are permitted where a risk assessment confirms they are suitable — typically for short-duration work where it is not reasonably practicable to use a more stable platform.

The [Werner Fibreglass Step Ladder](/site-equipment-ppe/werner-fibreglass-step-ladder/) is an appropriate choice where electrical work is involved, as fibreglass provides insulation that aluminium does not. Inspect ladders before each use — check for cracked stiles, missing feet, and damaged rungs — and never use a ladder that fails inspection.

## Electrical Safety on Site

Temporary electrical supplies on construction sites should operate at 110V centre-tapped-to-earth (CTE) where possible, in line with HSE guidance. This halves the voltage to earth and significantly reduces the risk of a fatal shock. Where 230V is unavoidable, RCD protection is mandatory.

The [Brennenstuhl 25m Cable Reel](/site-equipment-ppe/brennenstuhl-cable-reel-25m/) is built for site use and includes thermal overload protection. Cable reels must be fully unwound during use to prevent overheating — a basic rule that is frequently ignored and a common cause of site fires.

## Site Lighting

Adequate lighting is a legal requirement under the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations and the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations. Poor lighting contributes to slips, trips, and tool-related injuries. Portable lighting should be robust enough for a site environment and ideally rechargeable or battery-powered to avoid trailing cables where possible.

The [Makita DML186 LED Torch](/site-equipment-ppe/makita-dml186-led-torch/) is compatible with the Makita 18V LXT battery platform and provides useful task lighting without the need for a separate power source — a practical option for tradespeople already running Makita cordless tools.

## Bringing It Together

A compliant site is not just a legal obligation — it reflects directly on your reputation with clients and principal contractors. The basics are not difficult to get right: documented risk assessments, the right PPE for the tasks being carried out, first aid provision, safe access equipment, and managed electrical and lighting arrangements. Cutting corners on any of these areas creates liability that no saving in time or cost can justify.
