Whether you are maintaining a modest back garden or tackling a full landscaping project, choosing the right tools and materials from the outset saves time, money, and frustration. This guide runs through the key product categories — from lawn care and hedge cutting to paving, decking, raised beds, and storage — with practical advice on what to look for at each stage.

## Lawn Mowers

Choosing a mower comes down to lawn size, terrain, and how much effort you want to put in.

### Cordless Mowers

Battery-powered mowers have become the default choice for most domestic gardens. They start instantly, run quietly, and need far less maintenance than petrol alternatives. For a typical medium-sized lawn, a 36V or 40V platform is sufficient. The [Bosch UniversalRotak Cordless Lawnmower](/landscaping-outdoors/bosch-universalrotak-36v-cordless-mower/) is a well-regarded option with a single-lever height adjustment and a reasonably large collection box. Look for models with at least 40 minutes of runtime per charge and a cutting width of 36 cm or more.

### Hover Mowers

Hover mowers float on a cushion of air, making them well suited to awkward slopes and uneven banks where wheeled mowers struggle. The [Flymo EasiGlide 360 Hover Mower](/landscaping-outdoors/flymo-easiglide-360-hover-mower/) is a compact, lightweight option that handles sloping ground with ease. The trade-off is a smaller collection box compared to rotary mowers, so they work best on smaller plots.

### Robotic Mowers

Robotic mowers are now genuinely practical for gardens up to roughly 400 square metres. The [Husqvarna Automower Aspire R4 Robotic Mower](/landscaping-outdoors/husqvarna-automower-aspire-r4/) handles gradients up to 40% and returns to its charging station automatically. Installation takes a few hours to lay the boundary wire, but after that the mower works largely unattended. Running costs are minimal, and because robotic mowers cut little and often, they return clippings to the lawn as a fine mulch.

### Petrol Mowers

For large or particularly tough lawns, petrol remains the most powerful option. Battery technology is catching up, but a petrol machine will run indefinitely and handle long, damp grass without the concern of a depleted pack.

## Hedge Trimmers and Shrub Shears

For established hedges over roughly one metre tall, a powered hedge trimmer is the sensible tool. The [Bosch AHS 55-20 LI Cordless Hedge Trimmer](/landscaping-outdoors/bosch-ahs-55-20-hedge-trimmer/) has a 55 cm blade length suitable for box, privet, and beech hedges of moderate size. Check the tooth gap — a wider gap (around 24 mm) handles thicker stems, while a narrower gap gives a finer finish on formal topiary.

For tidying shaped shrubs, balls, and low box hedging, cordless shrub shears offer much greater precision. The [Bosch Isio Cordless Shrub Shears](/landscaping-outdoors/bosch-isio-cordless-shrub-shears/) weigh under 600 g and can switch between shrub shear and grass shear modes, making them a versatile addition to any shed. The [STIHL HSA 26 Cordless Shrub Shears](/landscaping-outdoors/stihl-hsa-26-cordless-shrub-shears/) are a step up in build quality and worth considering if you have a significant volume of topiary to maintain.

## Chainsaws

A chainsaw is necessary for felling small trees, cutting firewood, and managing larger woody growth. For most domestic users, a cordless chainsaw is the practical choice — no petrol mixing, no carburettor issues, and reasonable power for cuts up to around 30 cm in diameter. The [Greenworks GD40CS18 Cordless Chainsaw](/landscaping-outdoors/greenworks-gd40cs18-cordless-chainsaw/) runs on a 40V platform compatible with other Greenworks tools and has a 35 cm bar suited to most garden tasks. Always wear appropriate PPE: chainsaw trousers, gloves, a helmet with visor, and steel-capped boots.

## Pressure Washers

A pressure washer earns its keep quickly in any outdoor setting. Patios, decking, garden furniture, wheelie bins, and vehicles all clean up in a fraction of the time. The [Karcher K5 Power Control Pressure Washer](/landscaping-outdoors/karcher-k5-power-control-pressure-washer/) sits in a useful mid-range bracket — enough pressure (145 bar) for most household surfaces without being overkill. The variable pressure trigger is a sensible feature, letting you dial back the power on more delicate surfaces such as timber decking or painted fencing.

## Paving and Hardscaping

Hard landscaping materials represent a longer-term investment, so quality and consistency of thickness matter. Natural stone and quality concrete flags both work well in UK conditions, provided drainage is adequate and they are bedded correctly. The [Marshalls Argent Smooth Paving Slab](/landscaping-outdoors/marshalls-argent-paving/) is a good example of a structured concrete flag with a consistent finish and manageable size for DIY laying. Whichever material you choose, allow for a slight fall away from the house — around 1 in 60 is standard — to shed rainwater clear of the building.

## Decking Treatment

Timber decking requires annual maintenance to resist the UK's wet climate. An anti-slip treatment is particularly important in shaded areas where algae build-up makes boards treacherous. [Cuprinol Anti-Slip Decking Stain](/landscaping-outdoors/cuprinol-anti-slip-decking-stain/) penetrates the timber rather than sitting on the surface, providing both colour and grip in a single product. Apply with a wide brush or roller in dry conditions, ideally in spring before heavy outdoor use begins.

## Raised Beds and Sleepers

Raised beds are one of the most productive ways to use garden space, and they suit all skill levels. For a simple, scalable solution, a kit such as the [Conka Garden Raised Bed Kit](/landscaping-outdoors/conka-raised-bed-planter/) can be assembled without specialist tools and reconfigured as needed.

For a more permanent edged border or stepped terracing, [Treated Timber Sleepers 2400mm](/landscaping-outdoors/treated-timber-sleepers-2400mm/) are a robust choice. They stack and pin together easily and will last considerably longer than untreated timber in ground contact.

## Storage Sheds and Outdoor Storage

A quality storage building keeps tools dry and accessible, extending their working life substantially. Plastic sheds such as the [Keter Oakland 757 Storage Shed](/landscaping-outdoors/keter-oakland-757-storage-shed/) require no painting or treating, resist rot, and are straightforward to assemble. The Oakland 757 has enough floor area (7.5 x 7 ft) to house a mower, wheelbarrow, and general tools comfortably. For a more traditional look, timber sheds are available but require an initial treatment and periodic recoating.

## Hand Tools

No shed is complete without a core set of hand tools. Investing in quality here pays dividends — a well-made fork or rake outlasts several cheap alternatives. The [Draper Stainless Steel Border Fork](/landscaping-outdoors/draper-stainless-steel-border-fork/) resists rust and cleans easily, making it ideal for regular border work. For raking leaves and debris, the [Gardena Combisystem Adjustable Rake](/landscaping-outdoors/gardena-combisystem-adjustable-rake/) adjusts in width to fit between established planting.

If you buy regularly from tool brands that operate a multi-change handle system, such as the [Wolf-Garten Multi-Change Handle](/landscaping-outdoors/wolf-garten-multi-change-handle/), you can build a set of tool heads that all share the same handle — reducing cost and storage space over time.

For moving soil, compost, and materials around the garden, a solid wheelbarrow is indispensable. The [KCT 85L Galvanised Wheelbarrow](/landscaping-outdoors/kct-galvanised-wheelbarrow-85l/) has a galvanised steel tray that holds up to weathering far better than painted alternatives.

## Watering Systems

Hand-watering large gardens is time-consuming, and a retractable hose reel removes the usual tangle and trip hazard of a standard hose. The [Hozelock Auto Reel Retractable Hose](/landscaping-outdoors/hozelock-auto-reel-retractable-hose/) rewinds automatically and is designed for wall mounting close to an outside tap. For more extensive kitchen gardens or planted borders, a drip irrigation system connected to a timer can maintain consistent moisture levels through dry spells without any manual input.

## Buying Considerations

Before purchasing any major landscaping product, consider compatibility — battery platforms in particular are worth standardising across brands where possible to reduce the number of chargers and packs you need. Check warranty length and whether UK-based service support is available, especially for powered tools and sheds. For hard landscaping materials, always buy slightly more than your measured area to account for cuts and breakages.

Taking time to plan the project and select appropriate products at each stage will give you a garden space that functions well and requires less corrective work further down the line.
