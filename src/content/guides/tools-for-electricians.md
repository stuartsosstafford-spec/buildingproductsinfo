First fix is where the foundations of a quality electrical installation are laid — cable routes established, back boxes set, consumer unit positions confirmed. Getting through that stage efficiently and safely depends heavily on having the right tools on the van from the start. This guide covers what a first-fix electrician genuinely needs, from VDE-rated hand tools through to test equipment, cable detection, site lighting, and workwear.

## VDE Hand Tools

VDE-rated tools are tested to withstand 10,000V and are certified for use to 1,000V AC. For any electrician working on or near live conductors, VDE rating is not optional — it is the minimum standard. Beyond compliance, quality VDE tools make the physical work faster and less frustrating.

The [Wera Kraftform VDE Screwdriver Set](/electrical-lighting/wera-kraftform-vde-screwdriver-set/) is a consistently recommended choice among electricians in the UK. Wera's Kraftform handle is ergonomically shaped to reduce hand fatigue over a long day, and the blade tips are manufactured to tight tolerances — critical when you are driving screws in back boxes repeatedly without stripping them. The set covers the flat and Pozidriv profiles needed for most domestic and light commercial first-fix work.

For cutting, stripping, and gripping cable, the [Knipex VDE Pliers Set](/electrical-lighting/knipex-vde-pliers-set/) is the standard against which most electricians judge other options. Knipex combination pliers and side cutters are widely regarded as the best in class for build quality and longevity. The VDE insulation on Knipex tools is durable and well-bonded — a concern with cheaper alternatives where the insulation can peel or crack over time.

Other hand tools worth carrying from day one:

- **Cable stripper** — A dedicated wire stripper set to the correct diameter is far quicker than using side cutters and produces a cleaner strip that seats properly in terminals.
- **Junior hacksaw** — For cutting conduit and trunking cleanly.
- **Tape measure and spirit level** — Essential for setting out socket and switch heights consistently, particularly on a multiple-room first fix where uniformity matters.
- **Retractable knife** — Sheathing removal and general site tasks.

## Test Equipment

Carrying the right test equipment is a professional and legal requirement. A voltage tester should be used every time before working on any circuit, without exception.

The [Fluke T110 Voltage and Continuity Tester](/electrical-lighting/fluke-t110-voltage-continuity-tester/) is a compact, rugged instrument that confirms live or dead status quickly and reliably. Its CAT III 600V rating makes it appropriate for domestic and light commercial work, and the clear LED and audible indication reduces the risk of misreading results in a noisy or poorly lit environment. Fluke's reputation for accuracy and durability is well established; this is a tool that will outlast many site conditions.

At second fix and on socket verification, the [Martindale EZ150 Socket Tester](/electrical-lighting/martindale-ez150-socket-tester/) provides an instant check for correct wiring, reversed polarity, and missing earth on every socket outlet. It takes seconds to use and has caught wiring errors that would otherwise have been missed until a full installation test. Making it a habit at every socket saves time and credibility on handover.

A good rule for test equipment: never buy the cheapest instrument available. A faulty tester is worse than no tester at all because it creates a false sense of security. Stick to recognised names — Fluke, Martindale, Megger, and Kewtech all have strong reputations in the UK trade.

## Connectors and Termination

The [Wago 221 Series Lever Connector Box](/electrical-lighting/wago-221-lever-connector-box/) has become standard issue on quality domestic electrical installations. Lever connectors are tool-free, reusable, accept both solid and flexible conductors up to 4mm², and are accepted as a permanent connection method under BS 7671 when housed in an appropriate enclosure. A box of mixed 2-way, 3-way, and 5-way connectors covers the vast majority of first-fix termination situations.

The advantages over chocolate-block terminals are significant: they are faster to use, easier to inspect, and far less likely to produce a high-resistance connection from a poorly driven screw. On a busy first fix with multiple ceiling roses, junction boxes, and consumer unit tails to terminate, the time saving adds up quickly.

Carry a range of sizes on the van. Running out of 3-way connectors on a multi-light circuit wastes more time than the cost of keeping stock.

## Cable Detection

Before chasing walls, drilling through joists, or cutting into any surface where cables or pipes may be concealed, detection is not a step that should be skipped. The consequences of striking a live cable — personal injury, a damaged installation, and a potential insurance claim — far outweigh the two minutes it takes to scan the area properly.

The [Bosch Professional GMS 120 Cable Detector](/electrical-lighting/bosch-gms-120-cable-detector/) detects live cables, metal pipes, and wooden joists. Three separate detection modes allow the user to identify what is behind the surface before any tool goes in. On a first fix that involves chasing new cable routes through walls that may contain existing services, this is a daily tool rather than an occasional one. It is compact enough to carry in a tool bag without taking up significant space.

## Site Lighting

First-fix work frequently involves working in roof voids, floor voids, meter cupboards, and unfinished rooms where there is no existing lighting. A quality site torch on the belt or in the bag makes a measurable difference to productivity and safety.

The [Makita DML186 18V LED Torch](/site-equipment-ppe/makita-dml186-led-torch/) is a robust, high-output torch that runs on Makita's 18V LXT battery platform — the same batteries used in Makita drills, drivers, and multi-tools. For electricians already on the Makita platform, this is an obvious choice: no additional battery to charge or carry, and the output is considerably better than most consumer LED torches. The pivoting head allows the torch to be positioned as a hands-free work light when set on a flat surface.

If you are not on the Makita platform, a head torch that leaves both hands free is worth considering for any confined space work. Clip-on LED strip lights are also useful for illuminating a consumer unit position during installation.

## Workwear and PPE for Electricians

PPE requirements for first-fix electrical work are often underestimated. The hazards on a construction site go beyond electrical risk — manual handling, falling objects, and slips are all common causes of injury.

**Footwear:** Safety boots with S3 rating (steel or composite toecap, midsole protection, and heel energy absorption) are the minimum for any site with a general contractor or site rules in place. The [DeWalt Titanium S3 Safety Boots](/site-equipment-ppe/dewalt-titanium-safety-boots/) combine the required protection with a comfortable fit for a full working day. Electricians tend to cover a lot of ground on a first fix, moving between floors and crawling into roof voids, so comfort matters as much as compliance.

**Trousers:** Work trousers designed for trades offer knee pad pockets, stretch panels, and reinforced areas that standard workwear does not. The [Snickers 6241 AllroundWork Trousers](/site-equipment-ppe/snickers-6241-allroundwork-trousers/) are widely used in the electrical and plumbing trades. The Kevlar-reinforced knee pad pockets accept Snickers' D3O knee pads, which are worth adding if you spend significant time kneeling — on concrete floors during first fix, this becomes important quickly.

**Working at height:** Where a step ladder is needed to access ceiling voids or work at height, a fibreglass ladder is the correct choice for electrical work. Unlike aluminium, fibreglass does not conduct electricity. The [Werner Fibreglass Step Ladder](/site-equipment-ppe/werner-fibreglass-step-ladder/) is a reliable, EN 131-compliant option that is stable and well-built. Never use an aluminium or timber step ladder on electrical work where contact with live conductors is a possibility.

Additional PPE to carry on a first-fix job: safety glasses (for drilling, particularly overhead), gloves rated for general site use, and high-visibility vest if working on a site with a site manager or traffic management in place.

## Tool Storage

A well-organised tool bag saves significant time over the course of a first fix. Searching for the right screwdriver in a disorganised bag is a small frustration that accumulates into real time lost across a full week.

The [Stanley FatMax Technician Tool Bag](/site-equipment-ppe/stanley-fatmax-technician-tool-bag/) is a practical choice for carrying VDE hand tools, test equipment, and consumables. It has multiple external pockets for frequently reached items, a rigid base that keeps it upright, and enough internal capacity to carry a full complement of first-fix tools. The shoulder strap and carry handles mean it can be moved easily between floors on a multi-storey job.

For a first-fix electrician, keeping hand tools, test equipment, and connectors in the tool bag — and power tools in a separate heavy-duty tote or system case — makes moving between locations on site faster and keeps the bag at a manageable weight.

## Tool Storage on the Van

### Multi-Tool

The [DeWalt DCS356N Oscillating Multi-Tool](/tools/dewalt-dcs356n-oscillating-multi-tool/) earns its place on a first-fix electrician's van for the situations where other tools cannot reach. Cutting out back box positions in plasterboard cleanly, trimming cable clips in awkward corners, or removing grout around a conduit entry point — a good oscillating multi-tool handles all of these. The DCS356N runs on DeWalt's 18V XR platform and uses a tool-free blade change system, which keeps things moving on site.

## Summary

A first-fix electrician's toolkit does not need to be exhaustive from day one, but there are areas where the correct tool pays for itself quickly. VDE-rated hand tools from Wera and Knipex, a reliable voltage tester such as the Fluke T110, Wago connectors, and a cable detector should be considered non-negotiable. Site lighting, appropriate PPE, and organised tool storage are equally important for working efficiently and safely over a full week on site. Build the toolkit around quality basics first, and add specialist items as the work demands them.
