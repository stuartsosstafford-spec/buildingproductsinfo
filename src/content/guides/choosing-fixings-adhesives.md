Choosing the wrong fixing or adhesive is one of the most common — and most avoidable — causes of failure on building sites and in domestic projects alike. A bracket pulled from a plasterboard wall, a sealant joint that fails after a single winter, or a woodscrew that strips on first drive: these problems almost always come down to using the wrong product for the substrate or the load. This guide covers the main categories of fixings and adhesives used in UK construction and DIY, and how to select the right one for the job.

## Wall Plugs: Matching the Plug to the Substrate

Wall plugs are not a one-size-fits-all product, despite the tendency to grab whatever is in the nearest drawer. The substrate determines everything.

For solid masonry — brick, block, or concrete — a standard nylon plug works well for light to medium loads. The [Fischer DuoPower Wall Plug Assortment Box](/fixings-adhesives/fischer-wall-plug-fixings-kit/) is a strong choice here: the DuoPower design works across a range of substrates including solid and hollow materials, which makes it a practical option when you are not always certain what lies behind a surface. Similarly, the [Rawlplug Uno Universal Wall Plug](/fixings-adhesives/rawlplug-uno-universal-wall-plug/) is designed to perform in both solid and cavity materials, reducing the risk of selecting the wrong type on mixed-material walls.

For hollow materials — plasterboard, stud walls, or cavity block — you need a specialist toggle or cavity anchor. Standard plugs will simply pull through. Frame fixings are another option for securing items through plasterboard and into the structure behind: [TIMCO Nylon Frame Fixings](/fixings-adhesives/timco-nylon-frame-fixings/) are a reliable, cost-effective choice for fixing door frames, window boards, and similar applications through multiple layers.

As a general rule: drill the correct diameter hole for the plug (the plug packaging will specify this), use the correct screw size, and never over-tighten into masonry plugs — the plug needs space to expand and grip.

## Woodscrews: Quality and Quantity Matter

For timber-to-timber fixing, the main considerations are thread type, head profile, and surface finish. Pozi-drive and square-drive (Torx) heads are far more practical than slotted screws on site because they resist cam-out under power driving.

For general joinery and first-fix carpentry, a good twin-thread woodscrew with a countersunk head covers most situations. The [Reisser R2 Pozi Woodscrew Tub of 400](/fixings-adhesives/reisser-r2-cutter-woodscrew-tub/) is well regarded in the trade for its sharp point, aggressive thread, and reliable finish — these drive cleanly without pre-drilling in most softwood applications. If you need a variety of sizes on site, the [TIMCO Solo Woodscrews Mixed Tray](/fixings-adhesives/timco-solo-woodscrew-mixed-tray/) and the [Forgefix 1000pc Screw Assortment](/fixings-adhesives/forgefix-screw-assortment-box/) both offer a practical range of lengths and gauges for mixed work.

For external or treated timber, always specify stainless steel or hot-dip galvanised screws — standard zinc plating will corrode rapidly when exposed to the preservative chemicals in treated timber or to persistent damp.

## Screwdriver Bits: Don't Let the Bit Be the Weak Link

Even the best screws are only as good as the bit driving them. Worn or low-quality bits lead to stripped heads, damaged workpieces, and wasted time. A quality set such as the [DeWalt Screwdriver Bit Set (45 Piece)](/fixings-adhesives/dewalt-screwdriver-bit-set/) covers the most common Pozi, Phillips, Torx, and flat profiles with impact-rated bits that hold up under repeated use with a power driver. Keep a set of fresh bits on site — they are inexpensive relative to the cost of remedying a stripped fixings.

## Heavy-Duty Anchors: Chemical, Shield, and Masonry

When loads are significant — structural brackets, balustrading, overhead fixings, or anything safety-critical — standard plugs and screws are not sufficient. You need a tested, rated anchor system.

### Chemical Anchors

Chemical anchoring systems bond a threaded rod or rebar into a drilled hole using a resin that fills all voids and provides very high pull-out resistance. The [Hilti HIT-HY 200-A Injectable Epoxy Resin](/fixings-adhesives/hilti-hy-200-chemical-anchor/) is an industry-standard product used widely in structural and civil applications. It is ETA-approved and suitable for cracked and uncracked concrete, close edge distances, and seismic applications where relevant. For critical structural work, always refer to the manufacturer's load tables and ensure the correct hole diameter, embedment depth, and curing time are observed.

### Shield and Mechanical Anchors

For medium to heavy loads in solid concrete or masonry where chemical anchoring is not required, expansion anchors are the practical choice. [TIMCO Shield Anchor Projecting Bolt](/fixings-adhesives/timco-shield-anchor-projecting-bolt/) anchors are suitable for fixing steel plates, brackets, and structural timber to concrete. They work by mechanical expansion as the bolt is tightened, wedging the sleeve against the hole wall.

For fixing directly into masonry without plugs, [Thunderbolt M8 Masonry Concrete Anchor Screws](/fixings-adhesives/thunderbolt-masonry-concrete-anchor/) cut their own thread directly into the substrate and can be removed and reused, which makes them convenient for applications where some future access may be needed.

## Sealants: Silicone and Hybrid Formulations

Sealants serve two functions: weatherproofing and aesthetic finishing of joints. The choice of chemistry matters as much as the brand.

### Silicone Sealants

Silicone remains the standard for wet areas — bathrooms, showers, and around kitchen sinks — because of its excellent resistance to water, mould, and temperature cycling. The [UniBond Anti-Mould White Silicone Sealant](/fixings-adhesives/unibond-anti-mould-silicone-sealant/) is a reliable domestic option with a built-in fungicide. Bear in mind that silicone cannot be painted over, so it is unsuitable for joints that will be decorated.

For external joints — around window and door frames, expansion joints, or where movement is expected — a low-modulus silicone or a hybrid product is preferable. The [Everbuild Weather Mate Sealant](/fixings-adhesives/everbuild-weather-mate-sealant/) is a paintable, weatherproof sealant suited to external use where flexibility and UV resistance are required.

### Hybrid Sealant-Adhesives

Hybrid MS polymer and STPU products bridge the gap between sealants and adhesives. They are typically paintable, bond to a wide range of substrates without a primer, and offer excellent flexibility. [CT1 Sealant and Construction Adhesive](/fixings-adhesives/ct1-sealant-adhesive/) has a strong reputation in the trade for bonding in wet conditions and on difficult substrates where other products fail. [Sika Stixall Extreme Power Adhesive](/fixings-adhesives/sika-stixall-extreme-power-adhesive/) is another high-performance hybrid that provides both sealing and structural bonding in a single product, suitable for use on most common building materials.

## Grab Adhesives

Grab adhesives are used where mechanical fixings are not practical or desirable — bonding skirting boards, wall panels, coving, or composite materials. [UniBond No More Nails Original](/fixings-adhesives/unibond-no-more-nails-original/) is the best-known domestic grab adhesive and is adequate for light interior applications. For heavier or more demanding work, [Evo-Stik Gripfill Original Adhesive](/fixings-adhesives/evo-stik-gripfill-adhesive/) offers higher initial grab and gap-filling properties, making it a better choice for uneven substrates or heavier trim sections.

Always ensure surfaces are clean, dry, and free from dust or release agents before applying any adhesive.

## Masking and Painters Tape

Tape is often an afterthought, but poor tape selection leads to bleed, surface damage, or tape that refuses to remove cleanly. For general masking on internal decoration, [FrogTape Multi-Surface Painters Tape](/fixings-adhesives/frogtape-multi-surface-painters-tape/) uses a patented PaintBlock technology that seals the tape edge against capillary bleed, producing clean lines on most interior surfaces. For larger areas or where a wider tape is needed — masking off floor edges, window frames, or on site where 50mm coverage is standard — [tesa Professional Masking Tape](/fixings-adhesives/tesa-professional-masking-tape-50mm/) provides consistent adhesion and clean removal up to the specified maximum time on the packaging.

Check the temperature range and maximum application time stated on any masking tape — leaving tape in place too long, particularly in warm conditions, can result in adhesive transfer that is difficult to remove.

## Summary

Selecting the right fixing or adhesive is a matter of understanding the substrate, the load, the environment, and the compatibility of the product with the materials being joined. No single product covers every situation, and using a heavy-duty chemical anchor where a standard plug would suffice is as wasteful as using a grab adhesive where a structural bracket is needed. Use this guide as a starting point, always read the manufacturer's technical data sheet for load ratings and application conditions, and when in doubt about structural applications, consult a structural engineer.
