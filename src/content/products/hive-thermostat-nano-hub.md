## In-Depth Look

The Hive thermostat has been a staple in UK homes for years, and this latest version with the Nano 3 Hub represents a meaningful step forward. The hub itself is the most obvious improvement — it is a fraction of the size of its predecessors and plugs directly into your router, eliminating the need for a bulky box on a shelf.

### OpenTherm and Efficiency

OpenTherm compatibility sets this version apart from budget smart thermostats. Rather than the boiler firing at full output and then shutting off when the target temperature is reached, OpenTherm allows the thermostat to tell the boiler exactly how much heat is needed. The boiler then modulates its flame to match, reducing gas consumption and providing a more stable room temperature without the peaks and troughs of on/off control.

### Geolocation and Smart Features

The geolocation feature uses your phone's location to detect when you have left home and when you are returning. It can lower the heating when you are out and bring it back up before you arrive. In practice, this works well and is one of those features that, once set up, saves energy without any ongoing effort. Scheduling is straightforward through the app, and you can set different temperatures for different times of day across each day of the week.

### Verdict

The Hive Thermostat with Nano 3 Hub is a polished and reliable smart heating solution for UK homes with combi boilers. The smaller hub, OpenTherm support and geolocation make it a genuine upgrade over older Hive models and a strong competitor to Nest and Drayton Wiser. For installers, it remains one of the easiest smart thermostats to fit and support.
