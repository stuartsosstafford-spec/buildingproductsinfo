## In-Depth Look

Gripfill is one of those brand names that has become part of the language on UK building sites. Ask a joiner to grab some Gripfill and they know exactly what you mean, regardless of whether the tube in the van is actually Evo-Stik or not. The Original formula in the yellow cartridge remains the most widely used variant.

### Bond Strength and Gap-Filling

The solvent-based formula delivers a noticeably stronger bond than water-based alternatives, which is why many tradespeople still prefer it despite the odour. The gap-filling capability is particularly valuable when working on older properties where walls are rarely flat. Gripfill can bridge gaps of up to 10mm while still maintaining a strong bond, meaning skirting boards and architraves can be fitted without the need for packing or excessive amounts of adhesive.

### Practical Considerations

The solvent-based formula does mean strong odour during application and curing, so good ventilation is essential when working indoors. It is also worth noting that Gripfill forms a very strong permanent bond, which is an advantage for longevity but makes removal difficult if the joint ever needs to be dismantled. The ability to apply to damp surfaces is a genuine practical advantage on new-build sites where plaster may not be fully dry.

### Verdict

Evo-Stik Gripfill Original remains a top choice for construction adhesive bonding, and its longevity in the market speaks to its effectiveness. The solvent-based formula delivers strong bonds and excellent gap-filling that water-based alternatives still struggle to match. The odour is the main drawback, and users working in occupied spaces may prefer a low-odour alternative, but for site work where ventilation is available it remains hard to beat.
