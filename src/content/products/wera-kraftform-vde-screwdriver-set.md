## In-Depth Look

The Wera Kraftform VDE set has become the screwdriver set that UK electricians recommend to apprentices and experienced sparks alike. It represents a genuine step up from budget VDE sets without the extreme price of some premium alternatives.

### Safety

Every screwdriver in the set is individually tested to 10,000V before being rated for use at 1,000V. This is not a marketing claim — it is the IEC 60900 standard, and Wera applies it rigorously. The insulation is clearly marked and colour-coded for instant identification of VDE-rated tools.

### Comfort

The Kraftform handle is Wera's signature feature. The multi-component design places harder zones where torque is applied and softer zones where the hand rests, reducing blisters and fatigue during long days on site. For electricians who spend hours terminating circuits in consumer units, this makes a real difference.

### Verdict

The Wera Kraftform VDE set is the sweet spot between budget VDE screwdrivers and premium alternatives. It offers genuine German engineering, proper VDE safety compliance, and the comfort of Kraftform handles at a price that represents excellent value for professional electricians.
