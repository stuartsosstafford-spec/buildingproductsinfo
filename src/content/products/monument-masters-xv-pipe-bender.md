## In-Depth Look

Every plumber has a moment where a full-size pipe bender simply will not fit into the space they are working in. The Monument Masters XV exists for exactly those situations. It is a hand-held bender that lets you form accurate bends in 15mm copper without needing the leverage or bulk of a traditional bending machine.

### Build Quality and Design

The aluminium alloy construction keeps the weight down while providing enough rigidity to form clean bends. The former is precision-machined to match the outer diameter of 15mm copper tube, which is key to avoiding deformation. Angle markings on the body allow you to gauge the bend angle as you work, though experienced plumbers tend to do this by eye after a few uses.

### In Practice

Using the Masters XV takes a little practice. The technique is different from a standard bender — you grip the pipe and the tool together and apply pressure progressively. Rushing or jerking the bend will result in kinking, particularly with half-hard copper. Once you have the knack, though, it becomes second nature. Many plumbers carry one permanently in their tool bag because it saves reaching for fittings and flux on straightforward runs.

### Verdict

The Monument Masters XV is a practical and affordable tool that earns its place in any plumber's kit. It does one job well — bending 15mm copper in tight spaces — and it does it reliably. For anyone regularly working with copper pipework, it pays for itself quickly in saved fittings and time.
