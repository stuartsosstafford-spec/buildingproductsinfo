## In-Depth Look

Despite the dominance of power saws on modern building sites, a good handsaw remains an essential tool. Quick cuts, awkward angles, overhead work, and situations where setting up a circular saw takes longer than the cut itself — these are where a quality handsaw earns its keep every single day.

### XT Toothing

The XT hardpoint teeth are the defining feature of Bahco's professional handsaws. The teeth are induction-hardened to stay sharp far longer than conventional teeth — Bahco claims up to five times longer. In practice, this means weeks or months of regular use before the saw starts to feel dull. The trade-off is that hardpoint teeth cannot be resharpened with a file, so the saw is eventually replaced rather than maintained. At this price point, that is an acceptable compromise for most tradespeople.

### ERGO Handle

The 2-component handle is designed around the natural grip of the hand, with a softer material where the fingers wrap and a harder core for rigidity. This matters during extended cutting — a cheap plastic handle causes blisters and hand fatigue, while the ERGO grip stays comfortable even when cutting multiple lengths of timber in succession. The built-in 45 and 90-degree angle markers on the handle are a small but useful detail for marking quick lines without reaching for a square.

### Verdict

The Bahco ERGO 22-inch handsaw is the benchmark against which other site handsaws are measured. The XT toothing keeps cutting efficiently for far longer than budget alternatives, the ERGO handle remains comfortable through a full day of use, and the 22-inch blade handles everything from stud work to sheet materials. It is the handsaw that belongs in every trade tool bag.
