## In-Depth Look

A wheelbarrow is one of those tools that gets taken for granted until it breaks. The KCT 85L aims to be a dependable workhorse that handles years of regular use without rusting through or falling apart at the seams. It occupies the practical middle ground between budget plastic barrows and premium contractor models.

### Tray and Frame

The galvanised steel tray is the standout feature. Unlike painted or untreated steel trays that develop rust spots within a season, the galvanisation process provides a durable zinc coating that withstands moisture, soil acids, and general outdoor exposure. The tray shape is a traditional deep design that holds loose materials well and tips cleanly when emptying. The steel frame is powder-coated for additional protection and bolts together during assembly.

### Wheel and Handling

The pneumatic tyre makes a noticeable difference on soft ground, gravel paths, and uneven terrain compared to solid-wheel alternatives. It absorbs bumps and prevents the barrow from jarring over stones, which matters when carrying a full load. The trade-off is that pneumatic tyres can puncture and need occasional inflation, though this is a minor maintenance task. The handles are spaced at a comfortable width and the overall balance when loaded is good.

### Verdict

The KCT 85L Galvanised Wheelbarrow does exactly what a wheelbarrow should do, reliably and without fuss. The galvanised tray will outlast cheaper painted alternatives by a considerable margin, and the pneumatic tyre earns its keep on anything other than perfectly smooth surfaces. It is not the lightest barrow available, but the steel construction inspires confidence when shifting heavy loads of soil or aggregate. A solid choice for garden and light site work.
