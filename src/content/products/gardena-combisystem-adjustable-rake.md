## In-Depth Look

Gardena's Combisystem has been a fixture in European gardens since the 1970s, and the adjustable rake is one of its most practical heads. The ability to change the working width on the fly makes it more versatile than a fixed-width rake, particularly in gardens where you need to work around established planting as well as open lawn areas.

### Adjustability and Tines

The width adjustment works via a sliding collar that fans the tines inward or outward. At 30cm, the rake fits comfortably between plants and along borders. At 50cm, it covers open ground quickly for leaf clearance or post-mowing tidying. The transition between settings is smooth and does not require tools. The tines themselves are made from galvanised spring steel, which provides the right balance of flexibility for effective raking and stiffness for gathering heavier debris.

### Combisystem Integration

As with all Combisystem heads, this rake clicks onto any Gardena Combisystem handle. Gardena recommends a 130cm handle for this particular head, which gives a comfortable working height for most adults. The click connection is secure and wobble-free, and switching between heads takes only a few seconds. For gardeners who already own other Combisystem tools, adding this rake head is an efficient way to expand capability without accumulating more full-length tools.

### Verdict

The Gardena Combisystem Adjustable Rake is a clever, well-engineered tool head that justifies its place in any Combisystem collection. The adjustable width is a genuine practical benefit, and the galvanised tines should last well beyond the generous 25-year warranty period. The only real drawback is the need to buy a handle separately, but for existing Combisystem users this is a non-issue. A smart purchase for tidy-minded gardeners.
