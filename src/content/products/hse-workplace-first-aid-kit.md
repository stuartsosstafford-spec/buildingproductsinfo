## In-Depth Look

First aid provision on construction sites is not optional — it is a legal requirement under the Health and Safety (First-Aid) Regulations 1981. The consequences of non-compliance range from enforcement notices to prosecution, and the consequences of not having supplies when someone is injured are obviously far worse.

### HSE Compliance

This medium kit contains the items specified by HSE for workplaces with 11-20 persons. That includes a sufficient quantity of sterile dressings, plasters, bandages, eye wash pods, disposable gloves, and other essentials. Buying a pre-assembled compliant kit removes the guesswork of sourcing individual items and ensures nothing is missed that an inspector would flag.

### Documentation

The included accident book and inspection tags address the paperwork side of compliance. Every workplace injury must be recorded in the accident book, and first aid kits must be regularly inspected to ensure contents are present and in date. The inspection tags provide a visible record that checks are being carried out — exactly what a CDM inspector or HSE visit will look for.

### Verdict

The HSE Compliant Workplace First Aid Kit is a compliance essential rather than an exciting purchase, but it is one that every site needs. The medium size covers teams of 11-20 persons, the contents meet HSE specifications, and the included accident book and inspection tags handle the documentation requirements. Mount it on the welfare cabin wall, check it regularly, and restock as items are used. It is one of the simplest ways to stay on the right side of health and safety law.
