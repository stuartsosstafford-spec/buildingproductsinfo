## In-Depth Look

Having a well-stocked selection of common screw sizes is one of those things that separates a well-organised site or workshop from a chaotic one. The Forgefix assortment addresses this need directly, providing a thousand screws across a practical range of sizes in a case that keeps everything separated and accessible.

### Organisation and Practicality

The organizer case is the real selling point here. The nine removable cups can be lifted out individually, so you can take just the size you need to the work area without carrying the whole kit. The case itself is sturdy enough for van storage and stacks neatly. Having the PZ2 bits included is a thoughtful touch that means you can start work immediately.

### Screw Quality

These are functional, mid-range screws rather than premium fixings. They drive well in softwood and sheet materials, the pozi recess holds the bit adequately, and the zinc yellow coating provides reasonable protection for interior use. They will not match the performance of a Reisser or Spax in hardwood or demanding applications, but for general-purpose tasks such as fixing battens, mounting brackets, and assembling studwork they are perfectly adequate.

### Verdict

The Forgefix screw assortment is a practical and good-value kit for anyone who needs a ready supply of common screw sizes. The organizer case lifts it above simply buying loose boxes, and the range of sizes included covers the majority of everyday fixing tasks. It is best suited to interior and sheltered work, and tradespeople working with hardwoods or structural timbers will still want to supplement it with premium screws for those specific jobs.
