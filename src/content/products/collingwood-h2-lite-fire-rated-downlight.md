The 55-degree beam angle and 4000K neutral white output deliver clean, even illumination suited to kitchens, bathrooms and utility spaces."

## In-Depth Look

The Collingwood H2 Lite T has earned a strong reputation on UK building sites for its combination of compact size, quality light output and reliable fire rating. It is a step up from basic GU10 fire rated downlights, offering an integrated LED solution that takes the guesswork out of lamp selection.

### Integrated LED Advantage

With a GU10-based downlight, the quality of light depends entirely on which lamp the installer or homeowner chooses. The H2 Lite T removes this variable by building the LED module into the fitting. The result is a consistent 55-degree beam angle and 4000K colour temperature across every fitting on the ceiling. The 460 lumens at just 4.4W represents an efficacy of over 100 lumens per watt, which is excellent for a fire rated fitting.

### Bathroom and Wet Area Suitability

The IP65-rated front face means the H2 Lite T can be used in bathroom zone 1 (above baths and showers) when installed with an appropriate IP-rated back box. This dual capability — fire rated and IP65 — makes it a single product solution for bathroom ceilings, where both requirements must be met simultaneously.

### Verdict

The Collingwood H2 Lite T is a premium fire rated downlight that justifies its position in the market with integrated LED performance, IP65 capability and dimming compatibility. For electricians and specifiers who want a reliable, consistent downlight across an entire installation, it is one of the best compact options available.
