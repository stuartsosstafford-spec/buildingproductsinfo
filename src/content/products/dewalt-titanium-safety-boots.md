## In-Depth Look

Safety boots are the one piece of PPE that every construction worker wears every day, and getting them wrong means sore feet, blisters, and distraction from the job. The DeWalt Titanium has earned its reputation by getting the balance right between protection, comfort, and durability.

### S3 Protection

The S3 rating means the Titanium provides steel toe cap protection against 200-joule impacts, a steel midsole that prevents nail and sharp object penetration through the sole, and a waterproof upper. This is the minimum protection level required on most UK construction sites.

### All-Day Comfort

The padded collar and tongue, combined with the cushioned insole, make the Titanium comfortable enough for full working days on hard surfaces. Many safety boots sacrifice comfort for protection, but the Titanium manages to deliver both.

### Verdict

The DeWalt Titanium is the safety boot that UK tradespeople have trusted for years. It meets all site safety requirements, keeps feet dry and comfortable, and lasts well under heavy use. When your current pair wears out, you buy the same ones again.
