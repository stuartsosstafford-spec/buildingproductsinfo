## In-Depth Look

The Hager VML106 is a staple board for domestic electrical work in the UK. Since Amendment 3 of BS 7671 mandated metal consumer unit enclosures in domestic premises, the VML106 has become one of the most commonly specified boards for smaller properties, flats and extensions.

### Build and Layout

The steel enclosure is powder-coated white and feels robust in the hand. Inside, the DIN rail accepts standard Hager MCBs with a satisfying click, and the split-load busbars are clearly separated for the two RCD banks. Cable entry knock-outs are provided at both the top and bottom, giving flexibility for surface or flush mounting. The supplied circuit chart slots neatly into the inside of the cover for identification purposes.

### Amendment 3 Compliance

The metal construction is the headline feature from a regulatory perspective. Amendment 3 requires that consumer units in domestic premises are constructed from non-combustible material, and the VML106 meets this with its steel enclosure. The dual RCD arrangement also satisfies the requirement for division of circuits across at least two RCDs, so that a single earth fault does not plunge the entire property into darkness.

### Verdict

The Hager VML106 is a well-built, regulation-compliant consumer unit that suits smaller domestic installations perfectly. Its dual RCD split-load configuration, metal enclosure and Hager component compatibility make it a reliable choice for electricians who want a straightforward board for flats, small houses and extensions.
