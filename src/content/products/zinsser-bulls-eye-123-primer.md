## In-Depth Look

Every decorator eventually encounters a surface that refuses to accept paint. Whether it is a glossy kitchen cupboard, a PVC window board, ceramic wall tiles, or a ceiling stained by a historic water leak, Zinsser Bulls Eye 1-2-3 is the product that solves the problem.

### Universal Adhesion

The acrylic formula bonds to an extraordinarily wide range of substrates without the need for sanding or deglossing in most cases. This includes painted surfaces in any sheen, bare and previously finished wood, metal, plaster, PVC, uPVC, ceramic tiles, laminate, and even glass. For decorators, this versatility eliminates the need to carry multiple specialist primers — one product covers virtually every scenario.

### Stain Blocking

Beyond adhesion, Bulls Eye 1-2-3 performs well as a stain sealer. Water stains on ceilings, tannin bleed from knotty timber, and moderate nicotine discolouration are effectively sealed in a single coat. For very heavy staining — extensive smoke damage or decades of nicotine — a second coat of 1-2-3 or a step up to Zinsser's shellac-based B-I-N may be necessary, but for the majority of stain-blocking tasks this product handles the job.

### Practical Benefits

The water-based formulation means low odour during application and easy cleanup with soap and water, making it practical for use in occupied homes and commercial premises. The 35-minute drying time means surfaces can be topcoated within an hour, keeping project timelines tight. The primer accepts any topcoat — emulsion, gloss, eggshell, satinwood, or lacquer — without compatibility issues.

### Verdict

Zinsser Bulls Eye 1-2-3 is one of those products that should be in every decorator's van and every homeowner's paint cupboard. Its combination of universal adhesion, stain blocking, and ease of use makes it the most reliable solution for problem surfaces and difficult substrates.
