## In-Depth Look

The DeWalt DCP580N is one of those tools that consistently appears at the top of every "best cordless planer" list in the UK, and for good reason. It does one job exceptionally well: removing small amounts of material with precision.

### Door Fitting

This is where the DCP580N truly excels. The 9mm rebate capacity means you can plane a door edge to fit a frame without multiple passes, and the 0.1mm depth adjustment gives you the control to take off exactly the right amount. For joiners hanging multiple doors in a day, the cordless convenience and precise control save significant time.

### Blade Economy

The twin reversible TCT blades give you four cutting edges before you need a replacement set. This is a meaningful cost saving over single-use HSS blades, and the TCT edges stay sharper for longer, particularly when planing hardwood or MDF.

### Verdict

The DCP580N is the cordless planer that other manufacturers benchmark against. Its precision, rebate capacity, and brushless efficiency make it an essential addition to any joiner's or carpenter's tool kit.
