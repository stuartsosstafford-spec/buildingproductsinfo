## In-Depth Look

Sika Stixall is the adhesive that solved the wet substrate problem. On UK building sites, waiting for surfaces to dry before bonding is often impractical, and Stixall's ability to grip on damp and even underwater surfaces has made it a genuine go-to product.

### Hybrid Polymer Technology

Unlike silicone sealants (which do not paint) or polyurethane adhesives (which foam and expand), Stixall uses a hybrid polymer that combines the best properties of both. It bonds with high strength, remains permanently flexible, can be painted over, and does not foam or shrink.

### Universal Bonding

Stixall bonds to wood, metal, concrete, brick, stone, glass, ceramic, most plastics, and even polystyrene without dissolving it. This universality means one product in the van replaces several specialist adhesives, which is why it has become a default choice for tradespeople.

### Verdict

Sika Stixall is the adhesive and sealant that belongs in every toolbox. Its ability to bond virtually any material in any condition, combined with permanent flexibility and paintability, makes it the most versatile single product in the fixings and adhesives category.
