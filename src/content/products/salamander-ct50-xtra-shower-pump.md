## In-Depth Look

The Salamander CT50 Xtra is the shower pump that UK plumbers reach for when a customer complains about poor shower pressure in a gravity-fed property. It has earned its reputation through years of reliable service across thousands of UK installations.

### Twin-Ended Design

The twin impeller design is the key advantage of the CT50 over single-ended pumps. By boosting both hot and cold supplies simultaneously, it delivers balanced pressure to thermostatic shower valves — preventing the temperature fluctuations that plague single-pump installations.

### Installation

With 22mm push-fit connections, the CT50 Xtra is straightforward to install in an airing cupboard or loft space. Anti-vibration feet and quiet motor design mean it can be installed close to bedrooms without causing noise complaints.

### Verdict

The Salamander CT50 Xtra is the safe, proven choice for boosting shower pressure in gravity-fed systems. Its WRAS approval, twin-ended design, and quiet operation make it the pump that plumbers recommend with confidence.
