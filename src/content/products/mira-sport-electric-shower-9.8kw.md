## In-Depth Look

Electric showers remain essential in the UK market. They provide hot water on demand without relying on a boiler, making them the standard choice for en-suites, second bathrooms, and properties where the hot water system cannot support multiple outlets simultaneously.

### Thermostatic Stabilisation

The key feature that sets the Mira Sport apart from basic electric showers is its thermostatic stabilisation. When someone runs a tap or flushes a toilet elsewhere in the house, the cold mains pressure to the shower drops momentarily. In a basic electric shower, this causes a sudden spike in temperature. The Mira Sport detects this pressure change and compensates, maintaining a consistent shower temperature.

### Electrical Requirements

A 9.8kW electric shower draws significant current and requires a dedicated 40A circuit with 10mm2 cable. The cable size may need to increase for longer runs. This is a job for a qualified electrician, and Part P notification or certification is required. Installers should verify the existing consumer unit can accommodate the additional circuit before quoting the job.

### Verdict

The Mira Sport 9.8kW is the dependable electric shower that works in virtually any UK property. The thermostatic stabilisation genuinely improves the showering experience, and Mira's UK-based support and parts availability give both installers and homeowners long-term confidence.
