## In-Depth Look

The BG Nexus Metal range is one of the most popular decorative wiring accessory ranges in the UK, and the NBS22G double socket is the workhorse of the collection. It offers an affordable step up from standard white plastic sockets without venturing into the premium price territory of screwless flat-plate designs.

### Design and Finish

The brushed steel faceplate has a subtle grain that catches the light without being overly reflective. The grey inserts around the socket apertures and rocker switches complement the steel tone well. The outboard rocker design means the switches sit on the outer edges of the faceplate, which gives a cleaner appearance than centre-mounted rockers. The overall effect is modern and understated.

### Electrical Performance

Behind the faceplate, the NBS22G is a solid, well-made socket. The pillar terminals accept conductors up to 6mm2, which is more than sufficient for standard ring and radial circuits. Double-pole switching means both line and neutral are broken when the socket is switched off, providing a higher level of safety than single-pole alternatives. The socket conforms to BS 1363 and carries BG Electrical's 25-year guarantee.

### Verdict

The BG NBS22G is a well-priced, well-made double socket that upgrades the look of any room without breaking the budget. The extensive Nexus Metal range means every accessory in the house can match, from sockets and switches to dimmers and data plates, giving a professional, coordinated finish throughout.
