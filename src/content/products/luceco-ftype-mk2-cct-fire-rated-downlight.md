## In-Depth Look

The Luceco FType has quietly dominated the UK fire-rated downlight market by solving a simple problem: electricians used to carry warm white, cool white and daylight downlights separately. The FType MK2 CCT combines all four colour temperatures in one unit.

### Colour Temperature Selection

A simple slide switch on the back of the fitting lets you choose between 2700K (warm white), 3000K (neutral white), 4000K (cool white), and 6500K (daylight). This means the same downlight works in a cosy living room at 2700K and a bright kitchen at 4000K — decided at the point of installation, not at the point of purchase.

### Fire Rating and IP65

The FType MK2 is fire rated to 30, 60 and 90 minutes, meeting Building Regulations Part B requirements for all domestic ceiling installations. The IP65 rating means it is suitable for bathrooms and wet areas, eliminating the need for separate bathroom-specific fittings.

### Verdict

The Luceco FType MK2 CCT is the fire-rated downlight that simplifies life for electricians and gives homeowners a better result. Its selectable colour temperature, IP65 rating, and competitive price make it the obvious choice for domestic lighting installations.
