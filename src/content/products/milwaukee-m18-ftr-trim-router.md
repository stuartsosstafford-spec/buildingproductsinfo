## In-Depth Look

The Milwaukee M18 FTR represents a genuine step change in cordless routing. For the first time, a battery-powered trim router can genuinely match the speed and consistency of a mains-powered equivalent.

### Power Under Load

The POWERSTATE brushless motor is the defining feature. While other cordless routers bog down when cutting through dense hardwood or thick MDF, the M18 FTR maintains its RPM, delivering cleaner cuts with less burning. The variable speed dial lets you match the speed to the material, from 10,000 RPM for plastics up to 31,000 RPM for hardwoods.

### Plunge Base

The included plunge base with three adjustable stop pins transforms this from a simple edge trimmer into a versatile mortising tool. Kitchen fitters use it for hinge recesses, joiners for lock mortises, and the micro-adjustment system ensures repeatable depth across multiple workpieces.

### Verdict

The M18 FTR is a premium tool at a premium price, but for joiners and kitchen fitters who route daily, it pays for itself in convenience and quality of cut. It is the benchmark by which all other cordless routers are measured.
