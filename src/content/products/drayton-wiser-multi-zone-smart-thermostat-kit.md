## In-Depth Look

The Drayton Wiser has quietly built a strong reputation among UK heating engineers as the smart thermostat system they actually recommend to customers. While Hive and Nest get the consumer marketing, Wiser gets the trade endorsement.

### Multi-Zone Out of the Box

The key selling point of this kit is that it includes two smart TRVs alongside the room thermostat and HeatHub. This means you get genuine multi-zone control from day one — set the living room to 21°C, the bedroom to 18°C, and let the system manage the boiler accordingly. Additional TRVs can be added to cover every radiator in the house.

### OpenTherm

OpenTherm compatibility is a significant technical advantage. Instead of simply switching the boiler on and off, OpenTherm allows the Wiser system to modulate the boiler's output, matching the heat produced to the heat needed. This reduces gas consumption and improves comfort by eliminating temperature overshoot.

### Verdict

The Drayton Wiser Multi-Zone Kit offers genuine multi-room heating control at a competitive price, backed by Schneider Electric's engineering pedigree. For heating engineers looking to recommend a smart system to customers, and for homeowners who want more control than a single thermostat provides, it is one of the strongest options on the UK market.
