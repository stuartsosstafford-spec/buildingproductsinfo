## In-Depth Look

Robotic mowers have moved from novelty to necessity for many homeowners, and the Husqvarna Automower Aspire R4 is the entry point from the brand that has more robotic mowing experience than any other manufacturer.

### How It Works

A boundary wire is installed around the perimeter of the lawn (either pegged to the surface or buried just below it). The Automower navigates within this boundary, cutting grass in a random pattern that ensures complete coverage over time. When the battery runs low, it returns to the charging station automatically.

### Micro-Cutting

Rather than cutting the grass short once a week, the Automower trims a small amount frequently. This mulch-mowing approach returns fine clippings to the soil as fertiliser, promoting denser, healthier grass without the stress of heavy cuts. The result is a lawn that looks consistently maintained.

### Verdict

The Husqvarna Automower Aspire R4 is the robotic mower that makes sense for UK gardens up to 400m². The Husqvarna pedigree, app control, and quiet operation make it a genuine set-and-forget solution for lawn maintenance.
