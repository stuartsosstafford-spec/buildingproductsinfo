## In-Depth Look

Cordless mowers have reached the point where they genuinely compete with petrol for most domestic lawns. The Bosch UniversalRotak 2x18V-37-550 is the model that covers the majority of UK garden sizes with enough battery life and cutting performance to make petrol unnecessary.

### Dual Battery System

The dual 18V system uses two 4.0Ah batteries simultaneously, providing the power and runtime equivalent to a 36V system. Bosch includes both batteries and the charger in the box, so there is no additional cost to get started. The batteries are also compatible with other Bosch 18V garden tools.

### ProSilence Motor

The ProSilence motor is measurably quieter than both petrol mowers and older cordless designs. This is a practical advantage in residential areas where mowing early or late can cause friction with neighbours. The reduced noise also makes the mowing experience more pleasant.

### Verdict

The Bosch UniversalRotak cordless mower is the sensible choice for UK homeowners with gardens up to 500m². No petrol, no cables, no excessive noise — just charge the batteries and mow. The included batteries and charger make it ready to go from the first use.
