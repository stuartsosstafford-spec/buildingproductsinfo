## In-Depth Look

Wolf-Garten's Multi-Change system is one of the most established interchangeable garden tool ranges in Europe. The principle is simple: invest in handles and heads separately, mix and match as needed, and reduce the clutter of having dozens of individual tools. The ZM 85 handle is one of several lengths available, positioned as the short-reach option for ground-level work.

### Construction and Comfort

The aluminium shaft is noticeably lighter than wooden alternatives of similar length, which matters when you are using it for extended weeding or cultivating sessions. The D-grip sits comfortably in the hand and provides good leverage for pushing a hoe or pulling a cultivator through soil. The overall finish is clean and the connection point where the heads attach feels solid without any play or wobble.

### Multi-Change Compatibility

The real value of this handle lies in the ecosystem it opens up. Wolf-Garten offers dozens of Multi-Change heads, from rakes and hoes to weeders, edging tools, and even fruit pickers. Each head clicks into the handle in seconds, locking securely in place. For gardeners who already own several heads, adding this shorter handle to the collection gives a different working position and reach compared to the longer 140cm or 170cm options.

### Verdict

The Wolf-Garten ZM 85 is a well-made, lightweight handle that makes most sense as part of a broader Multi-Change collection. On its own it is simply a handle, but combined with the extensive range of compatible heads it becomes the foundation of a flexible, space-saving tool kit. The 10-year warranty adds confidence, and the build quality justifies the modest outlay.
