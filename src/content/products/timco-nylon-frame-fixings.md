## In-Depth Look

Frame fixings are one of those unglamorous but essential products that window and door installers use in large quantities every day. The TIMCO nylon frame fixing is a widely available and trusted option that combines speed of installation with a clean, flush finish.

### Installation Process

The fixing is pre-assembled, with the screw already threaded into the nylon plug. To install, drill through the frame and into the masonry behind in one operation using a 10mm masonry bit, insert the fixing through the frame and into the hole, then hammer it home. Final tightening with a screwdriver pulls the plug tight and secures the frame. The countersunk head sits flush with the frame surface, ready for decoration or cover caps.

### Why Nylon Matters

Using a nylon plug rather than an all-metal anchor offers two practical benefits. First, it prevents thermal bridging through the fixing point, which is increasingly important as building regulations tighten around thermal performance. Second, the nylon absorbs vibration and allows for a small amount of movement, which helps maintain the fixing's integrity as the building settles and the frame expands and contracts with temperature changes.

### Verdict

TIMCO nylon frame fixings are a reliable, practical choice for everyday frame installation work. They are fast to install, give a clean flush finish, and the nylon construction offers genuine advantages for thermal performance and durability. The 10 x 140mm size covers the majority of standard frame installations, and the TIMCO brand offers consistent quality that installers can depend on.
