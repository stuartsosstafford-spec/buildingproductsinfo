## In-Depth Look

The STIHL HSA 26 sits in the brand's compact AS battery range, designed specifically for lighter garden maintenance tasks rather than heavy-duty professional work. It fills a useful gap for gardeners who want the convenience of battery power without the bulk of larger hedge trimmers.

### Build Quality and Handling

The body is well constructed with a comfortable grip that allows extended one-handed use without fatigue. At just 0.65kg without the battery, it is one of the lightest powered trimming tools available. The blade changeover mechanism is straightforward and requires no additional tools, so switching between grass edging and shrub shaping takes only a few seconds.

### Cutting Performance

The 200mm shrub blade handles soft growth and light woody stems with ease, making it ideal for maintaining box hedging, lavender, and other ornamental plants. The grass blade trims lawn edges cleanly, though it is best suited to finishing work rather than tackling overgrown areas. For anything thicker than pencil-width stems, a dedicated hedge trimmer would be a better choice.

### Battery and Runtime

The included AS2 battery delivers a genuinely useful runtime. STIHL quotes up to 110 minutes, though real-world use with denser material will reduce this. Charging via the AL1 charger takes around three and a half hours. It is worth noting that the AS battery platform is separate from STIHL's larger AK and AP ranges, so cross-compatibility is limited.

### Verdict

The STIHL HSA 26 is a precise, well-made tool for light trimming and shaping. It will not replace a full-size hedge trimmer, but for topiary, small hedges, and lawn edges it is hard to fault. The dual-blade setup, long battery life, and featherweight design make it a strong choice for gardeners who value neat, detailed work.
