## In-Depth Look

The shift from rimmed to rimless toilets has been one of the most significant changes in UK bathroom design. The Roca Gap Rimless is the model that many plumbers and bathroom installers now recommend as standard.

### Rimless Advantage

Traditional toilet pans have an internal rim with holes that direct water around the bowl during flushing. This rim is a hidden surface that is difficult to clean and becomes a breeding ground for bacteria and limescale. The rimless design replaces this with a direct flush system that washes the entire bowl surface, leaving nowhere for dirt to hide.

### Wall Hung Installation

Wall hung installation raises the WC off the floor, creating clear space beneath for cleaning. The cistern is concealed behind the wall in a supporting frame, which also means a quieter flush and a cleaner visual appearance. The combination of rimless bowl and wall hung installation creates the cleanest possible bathroom layout.

### Verdict

The Roca Gap Rimless is the WC pan that delivers both form and function. The rimless bowl is genuinely easier to keep clean, the wall hung installation looks contemporary and simplifies floor cleaning, and the Roca build quality ensures long-term performance.
