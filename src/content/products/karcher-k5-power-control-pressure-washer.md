## In-Depth Look

A pressure washer is only as good as its motor, and the K 5's water-cooled induction motor is what separates it from the budget models. Where universal motors in the K 2 and K 3 range overheat during extended use, the K 5 runs cool and lasts for years.

### Power Control

The Power Control trigger gun lets you adjust the pressure setting to match the surface being cleaned. Full power for concrete and block paving, reduced pressure for timber decking and painted surfaces. This single feature prevents the accidental damage that fixed-pressure washers can inflict.

### Driveway and Patio Cleaning

At 145 bar, the K 5 has enough pressure to remove algae, moss, grime and ingrained dirt from most hardstanding surfaces. Combined with the optional surface cleaner attachment, it can clean a typical domestic driveway in under an hour.

### Verdict

The Karcher K 5 Power Control is the pressure washer for people who want serious cleaning performance without stepping up to contractor-grade machines. The water-cooled motor, adjustable pressure, and Karcher build quality make it a reliable long-term investment.
