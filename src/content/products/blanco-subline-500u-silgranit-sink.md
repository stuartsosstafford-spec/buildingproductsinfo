## In-Depth Look

The undermount sink has become the preferred choice for kitchens with stone, quartz, or solid surface worktops. The Blanco Subline 500-U is one of the most specified models in the UK market, and the Silgranit material offers advantages that stainless steel and standard ceramic cannot match.

### Silgranit Material

Silgranit PuraDur is composed of approximately 80% natural granite bound with acrylic resin. This creates a surface that resists scratching from everyday kitchen use, withstands temperatures up to 280 degrees Celsius, and does not stain from tea, coffee, wine, or food colouring. The material also incorporates hygiene protection that inhibits bacterial growth on the surface.

### Undermount Installation

The sink is fitted from below the worktop, with the stone or composite surface extending right to the edge of the bowl cutout. This requires a solid worktop material, as laminate worktops do not support undermount installation due to moisture exposure at the cut edge. The result is a smooth, continuous surface that makes kitchen cleaning faster and more thorough.

### Verdict

The Blanco Subline 500-U in Rock Grey is a premium kitchen sink that justifies its price through material performance and longevity. The Silgranit surface handles the demands of a busy kitchen without showing wear, and the undermount installation delivers both visual and practical benefits.
