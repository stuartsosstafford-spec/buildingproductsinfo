## In-Depth Look

The Rothenberger Pipeslice is one of those tools that has become so ubiquitous in UK plumbing that it barely needs an introduction. If you have ever watched a plumber work, you have seen one of these.

### Tight Space Performance

The Pipeslice's defining feature is its ability to cut pipe in places where a standard adjustable pipe cutter cannot physically fit. The compact body slides over the pipe and cuts with a simple rotating motion, making it invaluable for first-fix plumbing, boiler swaps, and radiator replacements where pipes run through tight voids.

### Cut Quality

The hardened cutting wheel produces clean, square cuts with minimal burr. This matters because a clean cut makes for a better solder or compression joint — and fewer callbacks.

### Verdict

At its price point, the Rothenberger Pipeslice is an automatic purchase for anyone who works with 15mm copper pipe. It is small enough to live permanently in a trouser pocket and reliable enough to last years of daily use.
