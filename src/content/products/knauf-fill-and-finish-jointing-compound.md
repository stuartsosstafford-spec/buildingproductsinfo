## In-Depth Look

Knauf Fill & Finish is the jointing compound that has made plasterboard finishing accessible to a wider range of trades. Where traditional jointing compounds required experience to mix correctly and skill to apply, Fill & Finish comes ready-mixed and is forgiving enough for non-specialists to achieve a good result.

### Two Coats, One Product

The first coat fills the joint, embedding the jointing tape and building up the profile. Once dry, the second coat feathers out the edges to create a seamless transition between boards. With traditional systems, these two coats used different products. Fill & Finish does both, which means less waste and fewer products to buy and store.

### Sandability

The lightweight formula sands down easily with fine-grit paper, which is critical for achieving a paint-ready surface. Heavier compounds can be difficult to sand without creating gouges, but Fill & Finish feathers out smoothly.

### Verdict

Knauf Fill & Finish is the jointing compound that makes plasterboard finishing straightforward. Whether you are a professional dry-liner or a builder taping joints as part of a wider project, the 2-in-1 formula, ready-mixed convenience, and easy sanding make it the obvious choice.
