## In-Depth Look

Cordless chainsaws have matured significantly in recent years, and the Greenworks GD40CS18 represents the capable end of the 40V consumer market. With a 40cm bar and brushless motor delivering 20m/s chain speed, it sits comfortably between light pruning saws and professional petrol models, making it well suited to garden maintenance and occasional firewood processing.

### Motor and Cutting Performance

The brushless motor is the key differentiator from budget cordless chainsaws. It runs more efficiently than brushed alternatives, generating less heat and extracting more cutting power from each battery charge. The 20m/s chain speed is competitive and makes clean work of both green wood and seasoned timber. The 40cm bar length gives enough reach to tackle logs and trunks up to roughly 35cm in diameter in a single pass, which covers most garden tree work.

### Safety and Oiling

The chain brake is activated either by the front hand guard or by kickback detection, stopping the chain almost instantly. This is a critical safety feature for any chainsaw, and its inclusion here is reassuring. The automatic oiling system feeds bar oil from the 180ml tank to the chain during operation, keeping the cutting system properly lubricated without any manual pumping. A visible oil level window makes it easy to check when a refill is needed.

### Battery Platform

This is a tool-only unit, so you will need a Greenworks 40V battery and charger. Both 2Ah and 4Ah batteries are compatible, with the larger capacity naturally providing longer runtime. For those already invested in the Greenworks 40V platform through other garden tools, this is an efficient way to add a chainsaw without buying into a new battery ecosystem. For new buyers, the additional battery cost should be factored into the overall investment.

### Verdict

The Greenworks GD40CS18 is a capable and well-specified cordless chainsaw that handles most domestic cutting tasks with ease. The brushless motor, auto-oiler, and proper chain brake bring a level of quality that justifies the step up from basic models. The main consideration is that the battery and charger are not included, so budget accordingly. For garden maintenance, firewood, and occasional tree work, it delivers a compelling cordless alternative to the noise and maintenance of petrol.
