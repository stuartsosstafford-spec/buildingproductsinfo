## In-Depth Look

Fire rated downlights are a regulatory requirement in most domestic ceiling installations, and the Aurora Enlite EN-FD101SN is one of the most widely used fittings in the UK market. Its combination of fire performance, GU10 versatility and clean satin nickel aesthetics makes it a go-to choice for electricians and installers.

### Fire Rating and Compliance

The intumescent pad behind the lamp holder expands when exposed to heat, sealing the ceiling aperture and maintaining the fire barrier for up to 90 minutes. This is essential in domestic properties where the ceiling forms part of the fire compartmentation between floors. Building regulations require this integrity to be maintained, and a standard non-fire-rated downlight creates a hole in that barrier.

### Installation

The fitting installs into a 70mm cut-out using spring clips that grip the ceiling material. No tools are needed for the clip mechanism — push the fitting up into the hole and the springs do the rest. The GU10 lamp holder is pre-wired with a loop-in, loop-out connector block, making daisy-chaining between fittings straightforward for the electrician.

### Verdict

The Aurora Enlite EN-FD101SN is a reliable, well-priced fire rated downlight that does exactly what it should. Its GU10 compatibility, 90-minute fire rating and quick-fit spring clips make it a practical choice for any domestic downlight installation where fire integrity matters.
