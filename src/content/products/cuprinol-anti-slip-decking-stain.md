## In-Depth Look

Timber decking is one of the most popular garden features in the UK, but it brings a well-known problem: it becomes dangerously slippery when wet or when algae takes hold. Cuprinol's Anti-Slip Decking Stain tackles both issues in a single product, combining colour and protection with practical safety features.

### Application and Finish

The water-based formula applies smoothly with a brush, roller, or pad applicator. It is low-odour compared to solvent-based alternatives and brushes rinse clean in water, making the job less messy. Two coats are recommended for the best colour depth and protection, with the first coat drying in around an hour and a recoat window of four hours. The Urban Slate shade produces a modern, cool grey tone that is semi-transparent, allowing the wood grain texture to remain visible. The final appearance will vary depending on the timber species and how weathered the deck is.

### Anti-Slip and Algicide Performance

The anti-slip microbeads are invisible once dried, so they do not affect the appearance of the finish. In practice, they provide noticeably more grip underfoot compared to a standard decking stain, particularly on damp mornings or after rain. The algicide within the formulation helps slow the regrowth of green algae and mould on the stained surface, though it will not eliminate the need for occasional deck cleaning entirely.

### Verdict

Cuprinol Anti-Slip Decking Stain is a practical choice for anyone with timber decking who wants to combine a colour refresh with improved safety. The anti-slip microbeads deliver a real difference in wet conditions, and the algicide extends the time between deep cleans. The Urban Slate colour is well suited to contemporary garden schemes. For best results, apply to clean, dry timber and allow adequate drying time between coats.
