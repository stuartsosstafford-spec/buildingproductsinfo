## In-Depth Look

The Wago 221 series has fundamentally changed how UK electricians make connections. What was once a niche product has become the industry default, with most electrical wholesalers now selling more Wago connectors than traditional screw strip.

### Lever Mechanism

The lever mechanism is the reason for the 221's success. Lift the lever, push the stripped conductor into the contact, and close the lever. The connection is made in seconds, with no screwdriver, no over-tightening, and no risk of the loose-strand breakage that plagues screw terminals. To disconnect, simply lift the lever and pull.

### Transparent Housing

The transparent body is a genuine safety feature, not a design gimmick. It allows visual confirmation that the conductor is fully inserted and making proper contact — something that is impossible with opaque screw terminal strips. For inspection purposes, this is a significant advantage.

### Verdict

The Wago 221 assortment box is the connector purchase that every electrician makes sooner or later. The 85-piece box provides a practical mix of 2, 3 and 5-way connectors in a reusable compartmentalised case, and the per-connector cost is lower than buying individual packs. Once you switch to Wago 221s, you do not go back to screw strip.
