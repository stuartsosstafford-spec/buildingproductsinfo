## In-Depth Look

Ideal Standard is one of the most established names in UK bathrooms, and the Concept Air range has become a go-to specification for mid-range bathroom refurbishments. The Grande basin mixer complements the range with a taller body profile suited to larger basins and countertop installations.

### Design Language

The smooth body design eliminates visible joints and seams, creating a streamlined form that is easy to clean and visually uncluttered. The single lever sits at the top of the tap body, controlling both temperature and flow rate in a natural, intuitive movement. The chrome plating is applied to a consistent standard, with a bright, reflective finish.

### Low Pressure Compatibility

With a minimum operating pressure of just 0.2 bar, this tap works on gravity-fed, pumped, and mains pressure systems. This versatility is important in the UK market where many properties still have gravity-fed hot water systems with relatively low pressure at bathroom level.

### Verdict

The Ideal Standard Concept Air Grande basin mixer delivers the quality and design coordination that makes Ideal Standard a reliable specification choice. The smooth body, included pop-up waste, and low pressure compatibility make it a practical tap for a wide range of UK bathroom installations.
