## In-Depth Look

The DCS391N has been a staple in the DeWalt 18V range for years. While it uses a brushed motor rather than the newer brushless technology found in the DCS572, it remains a popular choice due to its lower price point and proven reliability.

The 165mm blade handles most common cutting tasks — sheet materials, decking boards, and framing timber. The keyless bevel adjustment is quick to set, and the electronic motor brake adds a useful safety feature when making repeated cuts.

### Verdict

A proven, affordable cordless circular saw. If you're already in the DeWalt 18V system and don't need brushless efficiency, this does the job reliably.
