## In-Depth Look

Flymo has been synonymous with hover mowing in the UK for decades, and the EasiGlide 360 continues that tradition with a practical set of features aimed squarely at domestic gardeners. The hover design eliminates wheels entirely, allowing the mower to float on a cushion of air and move freely in any direction.

### Mowing Performance

The 2000W motor provides enough power to handle typical UK lawn grasses without bogging down. The 36cm cutting width strikes a good balance between coverage speed and manoeuvrability, and the four cutting height settings (10mm to 30mm) give reasonable flexibility for different seasons. The hover action means you can sweep the mower side to side rather than being locked into straight lines, which is a genuine advantage on irregular lawn shapes.

### Collection and Storage

The 26L grass box sits at the rear and collects clippings effectively, though it does need emptying fairly frequently if the grass is long. The real standout feature for many buyers will be the fold-flat design. The handle folds down and the mower can be stored vertically against a wall, taking up very little space. For those with limited shed or garage room, this is a significant practical benefit.

### Verdict

The Flymo EasiGlide 360 is a sensible, affordable hover mower that excels on uneven and sloped lawns where wheeled mowers struggle. It is lightweight, stores compactly, and does a respectable job of collecting clippings. For larger lawns or those wanting a pristine striped finish, a wheeled rotary mower may be preferable. But for straightforward, fuss-free mowing on tricky terrain, the EasiGlide 360 is a dependable choice.
