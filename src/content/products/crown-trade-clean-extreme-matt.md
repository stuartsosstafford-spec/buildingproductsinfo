## In-Depth Look

Crown Trade Clean Extreme represents the top tier of durable matt emulsions in the UK trade market. It goes beyond the scrubbability offered by products like Dulux Diamond Matt by adding anti-bacterial properties and resistance to cleaning chemicals, making it purpose-built for environments where hygiene and durability are equally important.

### Durability Under Pressure

The standout feature of Clean Extreme is its ability to withstand not just scrubbing with water and mild detergent, but cleaning with commercial disinfectants and sanitising solutions. In healthcare settings, walls are frequently wiped down with chlorine-based or alcohol-based cleaners that would degrade standard emulsions over time. Clean Extreme is formulated to resist this chemical exposure, maintaining its sheen and integrity through repeated cleaning cycles.

### Anti-Bacterial Performance

The anti-bacterial technology incorporated into the paint film inhibits the growth of bacteria on the surface between cleaning cycles. This is a genuine functional benefit in hospitals, care homes, nurseries, and food preparation areas, rather than a marketing gimmick. It is worth noting, however, that the anti-bacterial properties work in conjunction with regular cleaning — they are not a substitute for proper hygiene protocols.

### Finish Quality

Despite its heavy-duty performance characteristics, Clean Extreme achieves a convincing matt finish. Many highly durable paints develop a slight sheen that betrays their toughness, but Crown has managed to keep the finish flat and uniform. Application is similar to standard trade matt — it brushes and rolls well, with good flow and levelling.

### Verdict

Crown Trade Clean Extreme Stain Resistant Matt is the right product for environments where walls take serious punishment and need to be cleaned regularly with strong cleaning agents. Its combination of scrubbability, chemical resistance, and anti-bacterial properties makes it the specification choice for healthcare and education projects, and an excellent option for any high-traffic domestic space.
