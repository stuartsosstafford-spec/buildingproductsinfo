## In-Depth Look

Yorkshire Fittings have been synonymous with copper plumbing in the UK for generations. Their solder ring fittings are found in almost every domestic property in the country. The Tectite Sprint range extends that reputation into push-fit territory, offering an alternative for situations where soldering is impractical or unwanted.

### Copper-Specific Design

Unlike some push-fit systems that are designed primarily for plastic pipe with copper as a secondary option, the Tectite Sprint is engineered specifically for copper tube. This means the grab ring and seal are optimised for the consistent outer diameter and surface finish of copper, resulting in a secure and reliable connection. The fitting body is brass, which pairs naturally with copper pipework and avoids any concerns about dissimilar metal corrosion.

### When to Use Push-Fit Over Solder

Push-fit fittings come into their own in several situations: working in occupied properties where flame-free installation is preferred, making repairs where the water cannot be fully drained from the pipe, working in confined spaces where a blowtorch cannot be safely used, and when speed is the priority. They are more expensive per joint than soldered fittings, so for large new installations many plumbers still prefer to solder, but for service work and modifications, push-fit has become the default approach.

### Verdict

The Yorkshire Tectite Sprint 15mm coupling is a well-made push-fit fitting from a trusted manufacturer. It does what it promises — fast, tool-free, reliable joints on copper pipe. For plumbers who already trust Yorkshire for their solder ring fittings, the Tectite Sprint is a natural choice for push-fit work.
