The 25m cable reaches across most rooms and work areas, and the 3-way socket outlet means you can run multiple tools without fighting over a single plug. The thermal cut-out is a critical safety feature — if the cable is left fully wound under load, it prevents overheating that could damage the cable or start a fire."
whoItsFor:
  - "Tradespeople needing to extend mains power across work areas on site"
  - "Electricians and builders distributing temporary power during construction"
  - "Workshop users who need flexible power distribution for multiple tools"

## In-Depth Look

Extension cable reels are one of those site essentials that everyone uses but few think about until they fail. A cheap reel with poor connections, thin cable or no thermal protection is a genuine fire risk on a construction site. The Brennenstuhl name carries weight in this category for good reason.

### Cable and Capacity

The 25m H05VV-F cable is a standard flexible mains cable suitable for indoor and sheltered outdoor use. It reaches across most rooms and allows you to position tools where they need to be rather than where the nearest socket happens to be. The 3-way socket outlet at the end is a practical touch — trades often need to run a saw and a vacuum simultaneously, or a drill and a light, and having three outlets avoids the adapter daisy-chains that cause so many problems on site.

### Thermal Safety

The thermal cut-out is the most important feature on any cable reel. When cable is left wound on the drum under electrical load, it generates heat that cannot dissipate. This can melt the insulation and cause a fire. The thermal cut-out trips the power before temperatures reach dangerous levels. The proper practice is always to fully unwind the cable before use under load, but the cut-out provides a safety net when people forget — which they inevitably do.

### Verdict

The Brennenstuhl 25m cable reel is a reliable, well-built site power solution that does its job without drama. The 25m reach covers most situations, the 3-way outlet is practical, and the thermal cut-out provides essential safety protection. It is the kind of unglamorous but essential equipment that keeps sites running safely and efficiently.
