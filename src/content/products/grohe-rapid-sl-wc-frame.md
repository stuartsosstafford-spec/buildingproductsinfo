## In-Depth Look

The concealed cistern frame is the hidden component that makes wall-hung toilets possible, and the Grohe Rapid SL is the frame that most UK plumbers reach for. The 0.82m version addresses the common problem of limited wall space, making wall-hung installation viable in more bathrooms.

### Why the 0.82m Height Matters

The standard Rapid SL frame is 1.13m tall, which works well for most new-build bathrooms. However, many UK bathrooms have windows positioned low on the wall, or the stud wall construction does not allow for the full-height frame. The 0.82m version provides the same robust steel frame and reliable cistern in a package that fits these tighter spaces without compromising on flush performance.

### The 3-in-1 Advantage

Ordering a concealed cistern system as separate components introduces risk. Frames, cisterns, and flush plates from different manufacturers do not always work together seamlessly. The Grohe 3-in-1 set eliminates this problem entirely. Everything is designed as a matched system, from the cistern internals to the flush plate actuator.

### Installation Considerations

The frame bolts to the floor and to the wall behind, creating a self-supporting structure that carries the full weight of the WC and user. The adjustable feet allow the pan height to be set precisely. The cistern sits within the frame and connects to the water supply via a standard half-inch connection. Access for future maintenance is through the flush plate opening.

### Verdict

The Grohe Rapid SL 0.82m 3-in-1 set is the reliable, complete solution for wall-hung WC installations. The reduced height opens up more installation possibilities, and the inclusion of the flush plate means one order covers the full concealed system.
