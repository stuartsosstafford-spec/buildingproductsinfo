## In-Depth Look

Any decorator knows the frustration of peeling back masking tape to find paint has bled underneath, ruining what should have been a crisp line. FrogTape has built its reputation on solving this problem, and the Multi-Surface variant is the most versatile option in the range.

### How PaintBlock Works

The tape is treated with a super-absorbent polymer along its edges. When water-based paint touches this polymer, it reacts and swells to form a micro-barrier that seals the edge. This prevents paint from wicking under the tape through capillary action, which is the main cause of bleed with conventional masking tapes. The result is a noticeably sharper line, particularly on textured surfaces where standard tape struggles to make full contact.

### Application Tips

For best results, the tape should be pressed down firmly along its edge using a plastic tool or fingernail to ensure full contact with the surface. It should be removed at a 45-degree angle while the paint is still slightly tacky. Leaving it on too long, or until the paint has fully dried and formed a thick film, can result in the paint tearing along the edge rather than cutting cleanly.

### Verdict

FrogTape Multi-Surface is a genuine upgrade over standard masking tape for decorating work. The PaintBlock technology is not marketing hype; it produces measurably sharper lines, particularly with emulsion paints on walls. The price premium is real, but for any job where clean lines matter, it pays for itself in saved touch-up time.
