## In-Depth Look

The Scruffs Trade Flex trousers have built a strong following among UK tradespeople who want a step up from basic workwear without paying premium brand prices. They hit a sweet spot between comfort, durability and value that makes them a genuine contender against trousers costing twice as much.

### Stretch Fabric and Fit

The standout feature is the stretch fabric. Unlike rigid cotton work trousers that fight you every time you kneel or climb a ladder, the Trade Flex moves with your body. The slim fit keeps fabric out of the way — no loose material catching on scaffold fittings or dragging through mud. For trades who spend the day in varied positions, this makes a noticeable difference to comfort by late afternoon.

### Cordura Knees and Durability

The Cordura-reinforced knee pad pockets are where Scruffs has invested wisely. Knees are the first failure point on any work trouser, and the Cordura panels handle kneeling on concrete, timber and rough surfaces far better than standard cotton. The knee pad pockets accept Scruffs inserts, turning them into a genuine kneeling solution for tilers, carpet fitters and plumbers.

### Pocket Layout

The multiple pocket layout covers the essentials — cargo pockets for fixings, a ruler pocket on the thigh, and a phone pocket that keeps your device secure without digging into your leg when seated. The pockets are sensibly sized rather than oversized, which helps maintain the slim profile.

### Verdict

The Scruffs Trade Flex trousers deliver a convincing combination of comfort, durability and value. The stretch fabric and slim fit make them genuinely pleasant to wear all day, while the Cordura knees provide the toughness that site work demands. They are a smart choice for any tradesperson who wants workwear that works as hard as they do without breaking the bank.
