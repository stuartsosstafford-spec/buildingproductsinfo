## In-Depth Look

Bathroom extractor fans are a Building Regulations requirement in rooms without adequate natural ventilation, but the standard axial fans fitted in many UK homes are noticeably noisy. The Envirovent SIL100T addresses this with an engineering focus on noise reduction without sacrificing extraction performance.

### Noise Reduction

At 26.5 dB(A), the SIL100T operates below the level of a quiet whisper. This is achieved through the motor design and blade profile, which moves air efficiently without the turbulence that creates noise in cheaper fans. For en-suites attached to bedrooms, this level of quiet operation makes the difference between a fan that gets switched off to avoid disturbance and one that runs as intended.

### Timer Functionality

The adjustable overrun timer is the feature that makes this fan compliant with Building Regulations Part F for bathrooms without openable windows. When wired to the bathroom light circuit, the fan starts when the light is turned on and continues running for the set overrun period after the light is switched off. This period is adjustable between 1 and 30 minutes, allowing the installer to set an appropriate duration based on the bathroom size and ventilation requirements.

### Electrical Requirements

The timer model requires both a permanent live feed and a switched live from the lighting circuit. This means two cables need to be available at the fan location. In retrofit situations where only a single switched feed exists, the wiring will need to be extended. A qualified electrician should carry out the installation.

### Verdict

The Envirovent SIL100T is the bathroom extractor fan to specify when noise is a concern. The 26.5 dB operating level is genuinely quiet, the extraction rate meets Building Regulations requirements, and the adjustable timer provides proper moisture control for condensation-prone bathrooms.
