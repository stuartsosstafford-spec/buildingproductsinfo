## In-Depth Look

The Reisser R2 is one of those products that tradespeople tend to discover through word of mouth and then refuse to go back to cheaper alternatives. The difference is most noticeable when working with hardwoods or fixing close to the end of a timber, where standard screws would split the material.

### The Cutter Head Advantage

The small ribs machined under the countersunk head act as a reamer, cutting the timber fibres as the screw is driven home. This creates a clean countersink without the pressure build-up that causes splitting. In practice, this means carpenters can often work without pre-drilling, even in oak and other dense timbers, saving significant time on the job. The head sits flush and clean, leaving a neat finish.

### Drive Feel and Consistency

The Pozi No.2 recess is well-formed and consistent across the range, which translates to minimal cam-out and less damaged screw heads. The sharp point bites immediately, and the deep thread pulls the screw through timber quickly. These are small details, but over the course of a day driving hundreds of screws, they add up to less fatigue and fewer wasted fixings.

### Verdict

The Reisser R2 is a premium woodscrew that justifies its higher price through genuine performance benefits. The cutter head is not a gimmick; it makes a measurable difference to splitting, especially in hardwoods and near edges. For any carpenter or joiner who values clean fixings and reliable driving, the R2 is an excellent choice. The only caveat is the yellow zinc coating, which limits its use to interior and sheltered applications.
