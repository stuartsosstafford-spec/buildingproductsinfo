## In-Depth Look

The Stanley FatMax has earned its place as the default tape measure for UK tradespeople. The combination of standout, durability, and measurement clarity makes it the benchmark.

### BladeArmor

The first 150mm of the blade has a reinforced coating that resists the bending and wear at the hook end.

### Verdict

A sensible investment for any tradesperson. It costs more than a basic tape measure but lasts significantly longer and makes solo work easier.
