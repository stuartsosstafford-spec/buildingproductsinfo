## In-Depth Look

Kitchen tap installation is one of the most physically awkward jobs in domestic plumbing. The traditional method involves reaching into the tight space under the sink to tighten a backnut while holding the tap in position above. Bristan's Easyfit system addresses this problem directly.

### The Easyfit System

The Easyfit base consists of a clamp mechanism that is secured from above the sink deck. The tap body drops into the base and is locked in place without the need to access the underside of the sink for tightening. The flexible tails connect below as normal, but the main fixing is completed quickly and comfortably from above. For professional fitters, this can save ten to fifteen minutes per installation and considerably reduces the strain of working in awkward positions.

### Everyday Performance

Beyond the installation advantage, the Artisan is a well-balanced kitchen mixer. The single lever provides smooth, precise control over both temperature and flow. The swivel spout covers the full sink area, and the ceramic disc cartridge provides drip-free operation that lasts years without maintenance.

### Verdict

The Bristan Artisan Easyfit is the kitchen tap that professional installers appreciate. The Easyfit base genuinely speeds up installation and reduces the physical demands of the job, while the tap itself delivers reliable everyday performance with Bristan's established build quality.
