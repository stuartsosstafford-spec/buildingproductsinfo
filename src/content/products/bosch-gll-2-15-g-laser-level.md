## In-Depth Look

Laser levels have become essential for interior fit-out trades, and the shift from red to green lasers represents a genuine usability improvement. The Bosch GLL 2-15 G sits at the practical end of the green laser market — it is not a rotary laser for setting out foundations, but a compact cross-line tool for the jobs that trades do every day.

### Green Visibility Advantage

The human eye is more sensitive to green light than red, which means the green beam of the GLL 2-15 G is up to four times easier to see in typical working conditions. This matters most in rooms with natural light flooding in through windows or strong overhead strip lighting — exactly the conditions where red lasers wash out and become almost invisible. For kitchen fitters marking a level line across a room with patio doors, or electricians setting socket heights in a bright new-build, the difference is significant.

### Practical for Daily Use

At 15m range, this laser covers most interior rooms comfortably. The self-levelling mechanism settles within seconds of being placed, projecting horizontal and vertical cross lines for alignment work. The included LB 10 mount clips onto edges or screws into surfaces, which in practice is more useful than a tripod for interior work — you can mount it on a door frame, shelf bracket or any convenient edge at the height you need.

### Verdict

The Bosch GLL 2-15 G is the green laser level that makes sense for electricians, kitchen fitters, tilers and decorators who work primarily indoors. The green beam visibility alone justifies choosing it over a red laser equivalent, and the compact size with included mount means it is ready to use straight from the bag. It does not try to be an all-purpose surveying tool — it is a focused interior fit-out laser that does its job brilliantly.
