overview: "The Fernox TF1 Compact is the slimline version of Fernox's market-leading magnetic filter range. It combines hydrocyclonic action with powerful neodymium magnets to capture both magnetic sludge (iron oxide) and non-magnetic debris from system water, protecting boilers, pumps and valves from damage and improving heating efficiency."
whoItsFor:
  - "Heating engineers fitting filters as part of boiler installations and powerflushing"
  - "Plumbers maintaining and protecting existing central heating systems"
  - "Homeowners looking to improve heating efficiency and prevent breakdowns"
prosAndCons:
  pros:
    - "Dual filtration captures both magnetic and non-magnetic contaminants"
    - "Compact design fits where full-size filters cannot"
    - "Easy to clean without draining the heating system"
    - "Proven track record as part of the Fernox TF1 range"
  cons:
    - "Smaller capacity than the full-size TF1 Total Filter"
    - "22mm connections only — needs adaptors for 28mm systems"
    - "Requires isolation valves for servicing (included)"

## In-Depth Look

The Fernox TF1 Compact sits alongside the F1 Protector (already on this site) as one of Fernox's core central heating protection products. While the F1 is a chemical inhibitor, the TF1 Compact is a physical filter — and the two work best together.

### How It Works

The TF1 Compact uses two filtration methods simultaneously. Hydrocyclonic action spins water to separate heavier debris particles, while powerful neodymium magnets capture iron oxide sludge — the black magnetite that causes most boiler and pump failures. Together, they remove the contaminants that degrade heating performance and cause expensive breakdowns.

### Compact Advantage

The slim body is designed to fit flush against a wall, making it ideal for installations where space is tight — under a wall-hung boiler, inside a kitchen cupboard, or in a utility room. It connects directly to 22mm pipework using the included valve fittings.

### Verdict

The Fernox TF1 Compact is an essential component of any well-protected central heating system. Paired with Fernox F1 inhibitor, it provides comprehensive physical and chemical protection against sludge, corrosion and scale — the three main causes of heating system failure.
