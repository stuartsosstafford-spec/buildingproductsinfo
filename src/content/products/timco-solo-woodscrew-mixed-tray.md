## In-Depth Look

Every carpenter, joiner and general builder gets through woodscrews at a rate that makes individual box purchases inconvenient. The TIMCO Solo mixed tray solves this by providing 1,200 of the most commonly used sizes in one organised tray.

### Solo Range

The TIMCO Solo range is designed to drive into softwood and most hardwoods without pre-drilling. The sharp point, coarse thread and optimised geometry reduce splitting and allow fast, one-step fixing. For carpenters fitting battens, trims, and boards, this speeds up work significantly compared to screws that require pilot holes.

### Mixed Tray Format

The compartmentalised tray separates each size into its own section, making it easy to grab the right screw without rummaging through a mixed bag. The tray fits on a van shelf or workshop bench and keeps stock visible so you know when sizes are running low.

### Verdict

The TIMCO Solo mixed tray is the practical woodscrew purchase for anyone who uses screws regularly. The 1,200-piece count, organised tray format, and no-pre-drill performance make it a van essential for carpenters and general builders alike.
