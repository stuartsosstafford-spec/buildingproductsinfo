## In-Depth Look

Snickers work trousers have become the uniform of serious UK tradespeople. The 6241 AllroundWork is the model that balances all the features most workers need — stretch, knee pad pockets, holster pockets and durability — without being over-specified for any single trade.

### 4-Way Stretch

The stretch fabric is the feature that converts people from standard work trousers. Climbing ladders, kneeling under sinks, reaching into ceiling voids — every awkward position on site becomes more comfortable when the fabric moves with you instead of fighting against you.

### Holster Pocket System

The integrated holster pockets keep pencils, screwdrivers, pliers and other hand tools immediately accessible without the bulk and weight of a tool belt. For trades that use a limited number of hand tools throughout the day, holster pockets are faster and more comfortable than constantly reaching for a belt or pouch.

### Verdict

Snickers 6241 AllroundWork trousers are the work trousers that justify their price premium every working day. The stretch fabric, Cordura durability and intelligent pocket layout make them the standard by which all other work trousers are measured.
