## In-Depth Look

The Stabila 196-2 is one of those products where the reputation precedes it. Walk onto any UK building site and you will see these levels in use — their distinctive yellow end caps are as recognisable as any brand logo in the trades.

### Locked Vials

The locked vial system is the 196-2's defining feature and the reason tradespeople pay more for it than a budget level. Standard spirit level vials can shift after a drop, giving false readings that lead to expensive rework. Stabila's vials are permanently sealed into the body during manufacture, making them effectively immune to site knocks and drops.

### Double Plumb

Having two vertical vials (double plumb) means you can check plumb from either side of the level without flipping it around. This sounds like a small thing, but over the course of a day spent checking door frames, stud walls, or brick courses, it saves a surprising amount of time and effort.

### Verdict

The Stabila 196-2 is the spirit level that working professionals buy when they are tired of replacing cheap levels that lose their accuracy. It is a one-time investment that pays for itself through years of reliable, accurate readings on site.
