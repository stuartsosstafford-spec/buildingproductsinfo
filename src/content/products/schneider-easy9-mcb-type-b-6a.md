## In-Depth Look

The Schneider Easy9 6A MCB is the kind of component that electricians buy by the box. It is a straightforward, reliable miniature circuit breaker that does its job protecting lighting circuits without fuss.

### Type B for Lighting

Type B MCBs trip at between 3 and 5 times their rated current on a short circuit. This makes them the correct choice for resistive and light inductive loads such as lighting circuits, where inrush currents are relatively low. A 6A rating is the standard choice for a domestic lighting circuit in the UK, providing protection for cable rated at 1.0mm2 or 1.5mm2 twin and earth.

### Build and Installation

The MCB clips onto a standard 35mm DIN rail with a firm snap. The toggle has a positive action and the trip indicator window on the front face shows a coloured flag when the device has tripped, distinguishing it from a manual switch-off. Terminal screws accept conductors cleanly, and the finger-safe design means there is no risk of accidental contact during installation.

### Verdict

The Schneider Easy9 6A Type B MCB is a dependable, no-nonsense circuit breaker for domestic lighting circuits. It offers Schneider reliability at a price that makes it a sensible choice for electricians stocking up on standard components for everyday domestic work.
