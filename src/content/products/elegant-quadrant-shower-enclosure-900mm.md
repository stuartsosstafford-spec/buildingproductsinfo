## In-Depth Look

Quadrant shower enclosures are the standard choice for UK bathrooms where a corner shower needs to maximise the remaining floor space. The curved front panel eliminates the sharp corner that a square enclosure creates, giving more room to move around the bathroom.

### Glass and Safety

The 6mm tempered glass is the minimum thickness that feels substantial in a shower enclosure. Tempered glass shatters into small, relatively harmless fragments rather than sharp shards if it breaks, meeting the safety requirements for bathroom use. The easy clean coating applied to the glass surface helps prevent limescale and soap scum from bonding to the surface, reducing cleaning effort in hard water areas.

### Sliding Door Mechanism

The sliding doors run on twin metal rollers along a track at the top and bottom of the enclosure. This mechanism is important in bathrooms where a hinged door would swing into the room and block access to the toilet or basin. The roller mechanism should be checked during installation to ensure smooth, even operation.

### Verdict

The ELEGANT quadrant enclosure delivers functional shower enclosure performance at an accessible price point. The 6mm glass feels solid, the sliding doors are practical for tight bathrooms, and the 20mm wall adjustment handles the imperfect walls found in many UK homes.
