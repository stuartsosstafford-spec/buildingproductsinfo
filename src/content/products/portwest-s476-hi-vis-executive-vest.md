## In-Depth Look

The Portwest S476 is arguably the most common hi-vis vest on UK building sites. It is the default choice when you need something that meets regulations, carries your essentials, and costs little enough to replace when it gets torn or stained beyond saving.

### Compliance and Visibility

The EN ISO 20471 Class 2 certification is the key specification here. Most construction sites require Class 2 as a minimum, and the S476 meets this with its combination of fluorescent yellow background fabric and 50mm retro-reflective tape bands. The tape runs horizontally around the torso and vertically over the shoulders, providing 360-degree visibility in low light conditions.

### Practical Pocket Layout

What separates the S476 from a basic tabard is its executive pocket layout. The clear ID badge holder on the chest keeps your CSCS card or visitor badge visible without a separate lanyard. The phone pocket with flap closure is sized for modern smartphones, and the pen pockets and document pocket on the inside are genuinely useful for supervisors and site managers who carry paperwork.

### Verdict

The Portwest S476 does exactly what it needs to do — it keeps you visible, keeps you compliant, and gives you somewhere to put your phone and ID. It is not a premium garment and it will not last forever, but at this price point it does not need to. Buy a few, keep spares in the van, and replace them when they look tired. It is a site essential that earns its place through sheer practicality.
