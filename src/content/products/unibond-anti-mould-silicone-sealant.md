## In-Depth Look

Silicone sealant around baths and showers is one of those jobs that everyone encounters sooner or later. Old silicone turns black, peels away, and lets water behind the bath. UniBond Anti-Mould Silicone is designed to delay that process with a built-in fungicide that inhibits mould growth on the sealant surface.

### Anti-Mould Performance

The fungicide incorporated into the silicone is effective at preventing mould colonisation on the sealant surface for a reasonable period, typically one to three years depending on conditions. Bathrooms with good ventilation and extraction will see longer performance, while poorly ventilated, constantly wet areas will challenge any anti-mould product eventually. It is worth setting realistic expectations: no silicone sealant will stay pristine forever in a wet environment, but this product does extend the time between replacements.

### Application and Finish

Like all silicone sealants, the quality of the finish depends largely on application technique. Cutting the nozzle at the right angle, applying a consistent bead, and tooling with a wet finger or profiling tool within the skin time all contribute to a professional result. The acetoxy cure mechanism means a vinegar-like smell during curing, which dissipates within 24 hours. Surfaces must be clean, dry, and free of old silicone for proper adhesion.

### Verdict

UniBond Anti-Mould Silicone is a solid, mainstream choice for bathroom and kitchen sealing. The anti-mould protection provides a genuine benefit over standard silicone, and the product is widely available, easy to use, and competitively priced. It will not last forever in a demanding wet environment, but it offers a good balance of performance and value for routine sanitary sealing work.
