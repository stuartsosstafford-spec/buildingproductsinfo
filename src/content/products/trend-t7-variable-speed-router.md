## In-Depth Look

The Trend T7EK sits in the sweet spot between affordable DIY routers and top-tier German-engineered machines. It offers genuine professional performance — the kind needed for tight-fitting worktop joints and clean hardwood profiles — without the price tag of a Festool or Mafell.

### Power and Speed Control

The 2100W motor is the standout specification. When routing a worktop mason mitre joint or driving a 50mm straight cutter through oak, lesser routers slow down and burn the timber. The T7EK maintains its speed, producing clean cuts that need minimal sanding. The variable speed dial is equally important: large-diameter bits must run slowly to avoid dangerous vibration, while small profile bits need higher RPM for a smooth finish. The 8,000 to 22,000 RPM range covers both extremes comfortably.

### Precision and Plunge

The 66mm plunge depth is generous enough for deep housing joints and through-mortises. More importantly, the fine height adjuster allows micro-adjustments to the cutting depth, which is critical when fitting worktop joints where a fraction of a millimetre determines whether the joint pulls tight or gaps. The three-stage turret stop lets you set progressive depths for multi-pass cuts, reducing strain on both the bit and the motor.

### Verdict

The Trend T7EK is a dependable, powerful router that earns its place in the kit of any joiner or kitchen fitter. It lacks the refinements of routers costing twice the price, but for the core tasks of worktop jointing, edge profiling and housing joints, it delivers professional results consistently.
