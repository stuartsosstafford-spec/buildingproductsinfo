overview: "The Fluke T110 is the go-to two-pole voltage tester for UK electricians who need reliable voltage indication without the bulk and complexity of a multimeter. Its switchable load feature distinguishes it from basic voltage indicators by allowing you to detect and dismiss ghost voltages — induced voltages that appear on cables running alongside live circuits."
whoItsFor:
  - "Electricians needing a reliable two-pole tester for daily safe isolation"
  - "Electrical inspectors carrying out EICR testing"
  - "Maintenance electricians testing industrial and commercial installations"
prosAndCons:
  pros:
    - "Switchable load eliminates ghost voltage false readings"
    - "CAT IV 600V rating suitable for origin of supply testing"
    - "IP64 rating means it survives site conditions"
    - "Fluke reliability and calibration accuracy"
  cons:
    - "Higher price than basic voltage indicators"
    - "Requires proving unit for GS38 compliance (sold separately)"
    - "LCD can be harder to read in direct sunlight"

## In-Depth Look

The Fluke T110 sits in the sweet spot of the Fluke two-pole tester range — more capable than the T90 but at a lower price than the T150. For the majority of UK electricians, it provides everything needed for daily safe isolation and voltage verification.

### Switchable Load

The switchable load is the feature that separates serious two-pole testers from basic voltage indicators. When testing cables in trunking or conduit, induced voltages from adjacent live cables can give false readings. The switchable load applies a low-impedance load that collapses ghost voltages while displaying genuine supply voltages accurately.

### Safety Ratings

Rated to CAT III 690V and CAT IV 600V, the T110 is suitable for testing at distribution boards and at the origin of the supply. Combined with a Fluke PRV proving unit (sold separately), it meets the requirements of HSE guidance note GS38 for safe electrical testing.

### Verdict

The Fluke T110 is the two-pole tester that balances capability, safety, and price for the working UK electrician. Its switchable load and CAT IV rating provide the safety margins that cheaper alternatives lack, and Fluke's reputation for reliability means it will last years of daily site use.
