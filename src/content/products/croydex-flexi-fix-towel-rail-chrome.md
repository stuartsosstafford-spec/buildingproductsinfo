## In-Depth Look

Fitting accessories to tiled bathroom walls is always a moment of commitment — drill in the wrong place and you have a cracked tile and a hole to deal with. The Croydex Flexi-Fix system addresses this by allowing test positioning before permanent fixing.

### Flexi-Fix System

The Flexi-Fix mounting plate can be attached to the wall with adhesive first, allowing you to confirm the position is correct before committing to screws. If the position needs adjusting, the adhesive mount can be moved without leaving visible damage. Once confirmed, concealed screws provide a permanent, secure fixing.

### Build Quality

The chrome plated brass construction is a significant step up from the chrome plated plastic found in budget bathroom accessories. Brass does not flex, crack or yellow over time, and the chrome plating on brass provides a deeper, more consistent finish.

### Verdict

The Croydex Flexi-Fix Chester is the towel rail for people who value both quality and flexibility. The brass construction ensures it lasts, the Flexi-Fix system prevents costly positioning mistakes on tiled walls, and the concealed fixings deliver a professional result.
