## In-Depth Look

Dulux Trade Diamond Matt has earned its reputation as one of the most durable matt emulsions available in the UK market. It sits a clear step above standard Dulux Trade Vinyl Matt, using a reinforced binder system that gives the dried film genuine resistance to scrubbing and staining.

### Performance and Durability

Where standard matt emulsions begin to burnish or wear through after repeated cleaning, Diamond Matt maintains its flat, uniform appearance. This makes it particularly well-suited to corridors, stairwells, kitchens, and any area where walls take regular contact. The stain resistance is not just marketing — marks from crayons, scuffs from furniture, and splashes from cooking can typically be wiped away with a damp cloth without leaving a trace.

### Application and Finish

The paint applies smoothly with both brush and roller, though it does set up relatively quickly. Decorators need to maintain a wet edge, especially on large wall areas, to avoid visible lap marks. On the positive side, the opacity is excellent and most previously painted surfaces need only two coats to achieve a solid, even finish. The matt sheen level is slightly higher than ultra-matt alternatives, which contributes to its cleanability but may not suit those wanting the absolute flattest finish possible.

### Coverage and Value

At up to 17 square metres per litre on smooth, sealed surfaces, a 5-litre tin covers a reasonable area. Real-world coverage on new plaster or textured surfaces will be lower, so factor in an additional coat where needed. While the per-litre cost is higher than economy emulsions, the longevity of the finish and reduced need for redecoration mean it often works out more cost-effective over time.

### Verdict

Dulux Trade Diamond Matt is the sensible choice for any wall that needs to look clean and fresh despite daily wear. It is not the cheapest option on the shelf, but the durability and washability justify the investment for trade professionals and homeowners who want a finish that lasts.
