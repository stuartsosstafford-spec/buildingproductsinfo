## In-Depth Look

The Knipex Cobra is one of those tools that sells itself through word of mouth. Ask any plumber, electrician or mechanic in the UK what their most-used hand tool is, and the Cobra 250mm comes up with remarkable frequency.

### Self-Locking Jaw

The defining feature of the Cobra is its self-locking jaw mechanism. Unlike traditional water pump pliers that can slip under heavy torque, the Cobra grips harder the more force you apply. This means less risk of rounding fasteners and a much more confident grip on pipework and fittings.

### Push-Button Adjustment

The one-hand push-button adjustment is a genuine time saver on site. Instead of wrestling with a traditional slip-joint mechanism, you press the button, slide the jaw to the width you need, and start working. It is fast, precise, and works reliably even after years of daily use.

### Verdict

At around £28, the Knipex Cobra 250mm is one of the best-value tool investments any tradesperson can make. It replaces multiple tools, lasts for decades, and performs its job with a precision that cheaper alternatives simply cannot match. Buyers often come back for the 180mm and 300mm sizes to complete the set.
