## In-Depth Look

Cloakroom basins need to balance size with usability. Too large and they overwhelm the space; too small and hand washing becomes impractical. The Vitra S20 at 450mm wide sits in the sweet spot for most UK cloakroom installations.

### Size and Proportion

The 450mm width and 355mm projection give enough basin area for comfortable hand washing while keeping the unit small enough for the narrow cloakrooms found in many UK homes. The single tap hole accommodates a mono basin mixer, which is the most common tap choice for cloakrooms as it takes up less space than separate pillar taps and provides easier temperature control.

### Material Quality

Vitreous china is the standard material for quality sanitaryware. The glaze is fired at high temperature, creating a non-porous surface that resists staining, is easy to clean, and maintains its appearance over many years. Vitra's manufacturing quality is consistent, with well-formed edges and reliable glaze coverage.

### Verdict

The Vitra S20 is the practical cloakroom basin that delivers quality without unnecessary cost. The compact dimensions, clean design, and Vitra build quality make it a reliable choice for cloakroom and en-suite installations where space is limited but quality matters.
