## In-Depth Look

A tool bag is only as good as its base, and the Stanley FatMax Technician bag's waterproof hard base is what sets it apart from cheaper alternatives. On construction sites where every surface is wet, dusty or dirty, that hard base keeps tools dry and the bag upright.

### Waterproof Hard Base

The moulded plastic base is the feature that justifies the FatMax over generic tool bags. It creates a waterproof barrier between the bag contents and whatever surface the bag sits on, and it also gives the bag structural rigidity at the bottom. Tools do not roll around or settle into the base fabric.

### Organisation

The multiple internal and external pockets allow hand tools to be stored upright and separated rather than thrown into one compartment. External pockets keep frequently accessed items — tape measure, pencils, utility knife — immediately available without opening the main compartment.

### Verdict

The Stanley FatMax Technician bag is the tool bag that lasts. Its waterproof base, heavy-duty construction and practical pocket layout make it the standard choice for tradespeople who need a reliable, organised way to carry their hand tools between the van and the job.
