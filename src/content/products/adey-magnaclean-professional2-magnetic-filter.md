## In-Depth Look

The ADEY MagnaClean Professional2 is so widely specified that it has almost become a generic term — heating engineers often refer to any magnetic filter as "a MagnaClean." Its dominance of the UK market is built on a simple promise: it works, it is easy to service, and it protects the boiler warranty.

### How It Works

The Professional2 uses a powerful neodymium magnet with 360-degree coverage to attract and hold magnetite sludge as system water flows through the filter body. Magnetite — black iron oxide created by corrosion inside radiators and pipework — is the primary cause of boiler heat exchanger failure, pump seizure and valve sticking.

### Servicing

The quick-clean design is what sets the MagnaClean apart in daily use. During an annual boiler service, the engineer simply closes the isolation valves, removes the magnet, wipes off the collected sludge, and replaces it. The whole process takes under two minutes and produces no mess — a significant advantage over filters that require partial draining.

### Verdict

The ADEY MagnaClean Professional2 is the default choice for UK boiler installations, and for good reason. It does one job exceptionally well, it is fast to service, and the 10-year warranty provides long-term peace of mind. For heating engineers, it is the filter that keeps callbacks to a minimum.
