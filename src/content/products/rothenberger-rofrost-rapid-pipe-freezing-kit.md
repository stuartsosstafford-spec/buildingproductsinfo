## In-Depth Look

The Rothenberger Rofrost Rapid is one of those tools that pays for itself on the first job. Instead of spending an hour draining a system, making a repair, refilling, bleeding and re-pressurising, you freeze the pipe, do the work, and move on.

### How It Works

The insulated clamp wraps around the copper pipe and the freeze spray is applied through the clamp's inlet. The refrigerant rapidly cools the pipe, freezing the water inside to create a solid ice plug. As long as the plug remains frozen, you have a dry pipe to work on upstream or downstream.

### Time Savings

For a straightforward valve swap or tee insertion, the Rofrost Rapid can save 30-60 minutes compared to a full drain-down. In occupied properties — particularly flats and commercial buildings where a drain-down affects multiple areas — the time saving and convenience are even greater.

### Verdict

The Rothenberger Rofrost Rapid is an essential van tool for any plumber who values their time. The upfront cost is recovered after just one or two jobs where it eliminates a drain-down, and the reliability of the patented clamp system means you can trust it on customer properties.
