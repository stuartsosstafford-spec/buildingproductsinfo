## In-Depth Look

Gas tightness testing is a fundamental part of any gas work, and the U-tube manometer remains the standard tool for the job. While digital gauges exist and have their place, many gas engineers still prefer the simplicity and reliability of a U-tube for tightness and let-by tests.

### How It Works

The principle is straightforward. The manometer is connected to the gas installation via a test point, and the system is pressurised. Any drop in pressure over the specified test period indicates a leak. The U-tube design means there are no electronics to fail, no batteries to go flat, and no calibration drift. The red fluid simply rises and falls in response to pressure changes, and the graduated scale gives a direct reading in millibars.

### The Flexible Advantage

The key feature of the U-Flex over traditional manometers is its flexibility. Gas meters are often installed in cramped cupboards or outside in meter boxes where space is tight. A rigid glass manometer can be awkward to position and vulnerable to breakage. The flexible tubes of the U-Flex solve both problems — it can be bent around obstacles and will not shatter if knocked.

### Verdict

The Arctic Hayes U-Flex Manometer is an affordable, reliable and practical tool for gas tightness testing. It does not replace a digital manometer for all situations, but for standard tightness and let-by tests it is perfectly fit for purpose. Every gas engineer should have one as a primary or backup testing tool.
