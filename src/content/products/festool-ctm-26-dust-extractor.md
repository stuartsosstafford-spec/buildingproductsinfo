## In-Depth Look

The Festool CTM 26 E AC is more than a vacuum — it is a dust management system designed to work seamlessly with Festool power tools. For tradespeople cutting MDF, hardwood and sheet materials daily, M-class extraction is not a luxury but a health requirement, and this extractor delivers it reliably.

### Filtration and Automatic Cleaning

The M-class HEPA filter is the heart of this machine. It captures 99.9% of particles down to 1 micron, which is critical when cutting MDF or sanding hardwood — materials that produce the fine, invisible dust most damaging to lungs. The automatic filter cleaning system pulses air back through the filter at regular intervals, dislodging caked-on dust and maintaining consistent suction. In practice, this means you can work through a full day of cutting without stopping to manually clean or replace filters.

### System Integration

Where the CTM 26 truly excels is as part of the Festool ecosystem. The automatic tool start feature detects when a connected power tool is switched on and activates extraction instantly. The anti-static hose prevents the irritating shocks that plague cheaper extractors, and the SYS-Dock base lets you stack Systainer cases directly on top for a single, wheeled unit you can roll from van to site.

### Verdict

The Festool CTM 26 E AC is an investment, but for professionals who value their health and their finish quality, it is money well spent. The automatic filter cleaning alone saves enough downtime to justify the premium, and the M-class filtration provides genuine protection against fine dust exposure.
