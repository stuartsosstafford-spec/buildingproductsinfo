## In-Depth Look

Expanding foam is one of those products that every trade uses but few think about until they need it. Soudal gun-grade is the one that most professionals reach for because it delivers consistent expansion, good adhesion, and reliable curing across a wide range of site conditions.

### Gun Grade vs Hand-Held

Hand-held expanding foam cans are convenient for occasional use, but the straw applicator gives poor control and wastes product. A gun-grade can with a proper foam gun allows precise bead placement, adjustable flow, and the ability to stop and restart without the can clogging. For anyone using foam regularly, gun-grade pays for itself quickly.

### Common Applications

The most common use is sealing around window and door frames, where the foam fills the gap between the frame and the masonry while providing thermal insulation and air sealing. It is also used to seal around pipe and cable penetrations through walls and floors, fill voids in masonry, and temporarily secure items during construction.

### Verdict

Soudal gun-grade expanding foam is a van and site essential. The 750ml can provides enough foam for multiple applications, the gun-grade formula gives the control that professionals need, and the Soudal name guarantees consistent performance. Combined with a decent foam gun, it handles the majority of gap-filling and sealing tasks on any construction project.
