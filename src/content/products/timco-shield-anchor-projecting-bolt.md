## In-Depth Look

Shield anchors, also commonly known as rawlbolts, are one of the oldest and most widely trusted heavy-duty fixing types in construction. The projecting bolt variant is particularly useful where equipment needs to be bolted on and potentially removed later, as the threaded stud remains in place after installation.

### How Shield Anchors Work

The anchor consists of a threaded bolt passing through an expandable metal shield. The assembly is inserted into a pre-drilled hole in concrete, and as the nut is tightened, the bolt is drawn upward, causing the shield segments to expand outward against the walls of the hole. This creates a strong mechanical grip that resists both pull-out and shear forces. The four-segment design ensures even expansion and consistent performance.

### Projecting Bolt Advantage

The projecting bolt configuration leaves the threaded stud protruding from the concrete surface after the anchor is set. This means brackets, base plates, and equipment can be offered up, positioned, and secured with a nut and washer. If the equipment needs to be removed for maintenance or replacement, the nut is simply undone and the anchor remains in place, ready for re-use. This is a significant practical advantage over through-bolt anchors where the fixing is integral to the item being attached.

### Verdict

The TIMCO Shield Anchor Projecting Bolt is a reliable, proven fixing for heavy-duty applications in concrete and solid masonry. The M10 thread size provides strong load capacity for most bracket and equipment mounting tasks, and the projecting bolt design adds practical flexibility for installation and maintenance. The pack of 25 makes it a cost-effective choice for commercial and industrial projects where multiple fixings are needed.
