## In-Depth Look

The OX Speedskim appeared on the plastering scene and quickly divided opinion — traditionalists dismissed it, while those who tried it found they could not go back to trowel-only finishing. The reality is that for large, flat areas it is genuinely faster and produces a more consistent result than hand trowelling alone.

### How It Works

The principle is simple: a wider blade covers more area per pass, and the semi-flexible stainless steel follows the wall surface without digging in at the edges. You apply your skim coat with a trowel or hawk as normal, then use the Speedskim to flatten and level the surface in long, sweeping passes. The 1200mm width means a standard wall can be flattened in a fraction of the passes needed with a 280mm trowel.

### Semi-Flexible Blade

The ST (semi-flexible) blade is the most versatile option in the Speedskim range. It flexes enough to follow gentle undulations in the wall surface without bridging over hollows or catching on high spots. This forgiveness makes it suitable for renovation work where walls are rarely perfectly flat, as well as new-build plasterboard where surfaces are more predictable.

### Verdict

The OX Speedskim ST 1200mm is a genuine productivity tool for anyone who plasters regularly. It will not replace a trowel for detail work around switches, sockets and corners, but for the large flat expanses that make up most of a plastering job, it saves time and produces a better finish. The replaceable blade system means the initial investment keeps paying back over months and years of use.
