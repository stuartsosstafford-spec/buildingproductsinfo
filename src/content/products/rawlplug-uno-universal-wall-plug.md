## In-Depth Look

Wall plug selection used to mean carrying red plugs for masonry, brown plugs for block, and special toggles for plasterboard. The Rawlplug Uno simplifies this by providing a single plug that adapts to whatever substrate it is installed in.

### Universal Mechanism

In solid masonry, the Uno expands radially like a traditional wall plug. In hollow substrates like plasterboard or hollow block, the plug collapses and forms a toggle behind the board, spreading the load. This dual-action mechanism means one plug genuinely works in both situations.

### Anti-Rotation Fins

A common frustration with wall plugs is the plug spinning in the hole as the screw is driven. The Uno's anti-rotation fins grip the sides of the drilled hole, preventing rotation and ensuring the plug expands correctly as the screw tightens.

### Verdict

The Rawlplug Uno is the wall plug that simplifies site work. One 6mm drill bit, one plug type, and reliable fixings in whatever wall you encounter. The jar of 500 provides enough stock for multiple jobs and keeps the van organised with a single product instead of three or four.
