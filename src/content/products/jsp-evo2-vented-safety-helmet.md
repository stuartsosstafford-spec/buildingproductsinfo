## In-Depth Look

Hard hats are a non-negotiable requirement on construction sites, and the JSP EVO2 is the one you will see most often. It is not the most advanced helmet on the market, but it meets the standard, fits well, and costs little enough to issue to every worker and visitor without hesitation.

### EN 397 Compliance

The EN 397 standard covers protection against falling objects, which is the primary risk on construction sites. The HDPE shell absorbs and distributes impact energy, and the internal cradle harness keeps the shell away from your head to create a crush zone. This is not optional — site access on any professionally managed project requires EN 397 as a minimum.

### Ventilation and Comfort

The vented version of the EVO2 has slots moulded into the shell that allow air circulation around the head. On warm days, this makes a measurable difference to comfort — unvented helmets trap heat and moisture, leading to headaches and fatigue by mid-afternoon. The trade-off is that vented helmets should not be used for electrical work or in environments where molten metal splash is a risk, as the vents create entry points.

### Verdict

The JSP EVO2 is the hard hat that gets the job done for the vast majority of UK construction workers. It is EN 397 compliant, the ventilation helps with comfort, and the slip ratchet makes it easy to get a secure fit. It will not win awards for innovation, but it is the reliable, affordable standard that keeps heads protected on sites across the country.
