## In-Depth Look

The Timeguard FST24 has been a standard fitting in UK airing cupboards for years. It provides a simple, reliable way to put an immersion heater or storage heater on a timer without the need for a separate time clock or smart controller.

### How It Works

The FST24 replaces a standard fused connection unit on the wall. Inside, a 24-hour mechanical clock drives a switching mechanism that turns the connected load on and off according to the segments pushed in or out on the timer dial. Each segment represents 15 minutes, so you can programme multiple heating periods throughout the day. A manual override switch on the front allows the load to be turned on or off independently of the timer.

### Typical Applications

The most common use is controlling an immersion heater on an Economy 7 or Economy 10 electricity tariff, where hot water is heated during cheaper off-peak hours. It is also used for storage heaters, towel rails, and any other hardwired appliance up to 13A that benefits from timed operation. The neon indicator on the front confirms at a glance whether the load is currently energised.

### Verdict

The Timeguard FST24 is a proven, no-nonsense solution for adding timed control to hardwired appliances. Its mechanical simplicity means there are no batteries to replace, no apps to configure, and no connectivity to troubleshoot — just push the segments and let the timer do its job.
