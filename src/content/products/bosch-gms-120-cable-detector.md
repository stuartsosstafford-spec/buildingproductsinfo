## In-Depth Look

The Bosch GMS 120 is one of those tools that every trade van should carry. A few seconds of scanning before drilling can prevent cutting through a mains cable, puncturing a water pipe, or missing a stud entirely.

### Three Modes

The drywall mode detects wooden studs and joists behind plasterboard. The metal mode picks up ferrous and non-ferrous metals — copper pipes, steel beams, rebar. The live cable mode detects energised wiring. Switching between modes is a single button press.

### Traffic Light Feedback

The illuminated ring around the display changes colour as you scan: green when the area is clear, yellow when approaching an object, and red when directly over it. This is far more intuitive than numerical displays, especially when working overhead or in dim conditions.

### Verdict

The Bosch GMS 120 is the professional wall scanner that trades across all disciplines rely on. Its combination of three detection modes, centre-finding accuracy, and intuitive traffic light display makes it an essential safety tool for anyone who drills into walls.
