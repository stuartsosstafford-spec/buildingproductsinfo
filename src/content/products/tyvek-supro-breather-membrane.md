## In-Depth Look

Tyvek Supro has earned its reputation as the go-to breather membrane for UK construction. Whether it is used as a pitched roof underlay or a timber frame wall membrane, it delivers consistent performance that building control inspectors recognise immediately.

### Why Breathable Membranes Matter

Traditional roofing felt traps moisture vapour inside the roof structure, leading to condensation on the underside of the membrane and potential timber decay. A breather membrane like Tyvek Supro allows moisture vapour to pass through from inside to outside while preventing rain and wind from penetrating inward. This is essential for modern energy-efficient buildings with high insulation levels.

### BBA Certification

The BBA certificate is what sets Tyvek Supro apart from cheaper alternatives. Building control officers accept BBA-certified products without further evidence, which avoids delays on site. For warranty purposes, many timber frame manufacturers also require a BBA-certified breather membrane.

### Verdict

Tyvek Supro is the breather membrane that professionals specify when the building needs to perform correctly for decades. The cost premium over generic alternatives is small relative to the total build cost, and the BBA certification removes any doubt at inspection stage.
