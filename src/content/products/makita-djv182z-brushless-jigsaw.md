## In-Depth Look

The Makita DJV182Z is the kind of tool that tradespeople buy once and wonder how they managed without. Its brushless motor delivers the sort of cutting performance you would expect from a corded jigsaw, but with the freedom of the 18V LXT battery platform.

### Cutting Performance

With a 26mm stroke length and variable speed up to 3,500 SPM, the DJV182Z handles everything from delicate scrollwork in MDF to aggressive rip cuts through thick softwood. The 4-stage orbital action lets you match the cut aggressiveness to the material, and the 135mm maximum depth in wood covers the vast majority of site cutting tasks.

### Soft No-Load

Makita's Soft No-Load technology is the standout feature for all-day use. When the blade is not under load, the motor automatically drops to a lower speed, reducing vibration and extending both battery life and user comfort. For tradespeople making dozens of cuts across a shift, this is a genuine fatigue reducer.

### Verdict

The DJV182Z delivers genuine trade-level jigsaw performance in a cordless package. Its combination of cutting depth, orbital action, and the Soft No-Load system makes it one of the best cordless jigsaws available on the UK market.
