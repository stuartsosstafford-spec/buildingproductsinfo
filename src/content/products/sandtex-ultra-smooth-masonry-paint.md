## In-Depth Look

Exterior masonry paint needs to do a demanding job — it must withstand years of UK rain, frost, UV exposure, and temperature fluctuation while maintaining its appearance. Sandtex Ultra Smooth has built a strong reputation for delivering on these requirements.

### Weather Protection

The 15-year protection guarantee reflects a formulation designed specifically for the British climate. The paint film is microporous, meaning it allows water vapour from within the masonry to pass through and evaporate, preventing the blistering and peeling that occurs when moisture becomes trapped behind a non-breathable coating. At the same time, the outer surface repels rainwater, preventing it from soaking into the substrate. This balance between breathability and water resistance is what separates quality masonry paint from cheaper alternatives.

### Finish and Appearance

The smooth finish gives a clean, contemporary look to exterior walls. It works well on render, brick, stone, and pebbledash, though on very rough or heavily textured surfaces a textured masonry paint may be more appropriate. The Brilliant White shade includes optical brighteners that help maintain a fresh appearance, and the dirt-resistant technology in the formulation means the surface sheds airborne grime more effectively than standard paints.

### Application Tips

Two coats are recommended for optimal protection and appearance, with the first coat thinned slightly on bare or porous surfaces to act as a primer. Application is straightforward with a long-pile masonry roller and brush for cutting in. The critical factor is weather — the paint needs at least 2 hours of dry conditions after application to cure sufficiently, so checking the forecast before starting is essential.

### Verdict

Sandtex Ultra Smooth Masonry Paint is a reliable choice for exterior redecoration that balances performance, coverage, and value. The 15-year protection is realistic in practice, and the 7.5-litre tin size offers good value for typical house-front projects. It remains one of the strongest options in the UK exterior masonry paint market.
