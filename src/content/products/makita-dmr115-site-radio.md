The IP65 rating means dust, rain and the occasional splash from a wet trade will not kill it. Running on the same 18V LXT batteries as Makita power tools means no separate charging system, and the Bluetooth connection lets you stream podcasts or playlists when DAB reception is patchy."
whoItsFor:
  - "Tradespeople already in the Makita 18V LXT battery ecosystem"
  - "Site teams wanting a shared radio that survives harsh jobsite conditions"
  - "Solo workers who want reliable entertainment and a phone charger in one unit"
prosAndCons:
  pros:
    - "IP65 rating genuinely protects against site dust and rain"
    - "Uses the same 18V LXT batteries as Makita power tools"
    - "Bluetooth streaming fills gaps where DAB reception drops out"
    - "USB port doubles as a convenient phone charger on site"
  cons:
    - "Battery not included — requires existing Makita 18V LXT battery"
    - "Heavier than consumer radios due to rugged construction"
    - "Sound quality is functional rather than audiophile grade"

## In-Depth Look

A radio on a building site is not a luxury — it keeps morale up on long days and helps solo workers stay alert. The Makita DMR115 is designed specifically for this environment, where cheap consumer radios get destroyed by dust, damp and the inevitable knock off a workbench.

### Built for Site Life

The IP65 rating is not just marketing. Dust ingress is a genuine killer of electronics on construction sites, and water jets from cleaning or rain through open structures finish off whatever the dust started. The rubberised housing absorbs impacts, and the roll cage design protects the speakers and controls when the radio inevitably gets knocked over or buried under materials.

### Power Options

Running on Makita 18V LXT batteries is a major convenience if you are already in the Makita ecosystem. A 5.0Ah battery gives hours of listening, and you can swap a fresh one in from the same charger powering your drill and saw batteries. The included mains adapter covers situations where you have power on site and want to save battery capacity for tools.

### DAB+ and Bluetooth

DAB+ reception on building sites can be inconsistent, especially inside steel-framed structures or basements. The Bluetooth connection solves this — pair your phone and stream whatever you want regardless of radio reception. The USB charging port is a thoughtful addition that means your phone stays charged even when streaming all day.

### Verdict

The Makita DMR115 is the jobsite radio that makes sense for anyone already using Makita 18V tools. It is tough enough for genuine site conditions, versatile enough with DAB+ and Bluetooth, and the shared battery system means one less charger to carry. It does exactly what a site radio should do — it works reliably in conditions that destroy ordinary electronics.
