overview: "The Drayton TRV4 is the UK's most widely installed thermostatic radiator valve head. It uses a wax-filled sensor to detect room temperature and regulate the flow of hot water through the radiator accordingly. When the room reaches the set temperature, the wax expands and closes the valve, reducing heat output. As the room cools, the wax contracts and the valve opens again. This simple mechanical process requires no batteries or power supply and provides reliable room-by-room temperature control across the life of the heating system."
whoItsFor:
  - "Plumbers and heating engineers fitting or replacing TRV heads"
  - "Homeowners looking to replace worn or stiff TRV heads for better room temperature control"
  - "Landlords needing cost-effective and reliable temperature regulation in rental properties"
prosAndCons:
  pros:
    - "Proven reliability with millions installed across the UK"
    - "Wax sensor provides consistent temperature regulation without batteries"
    - "Standard M30 thread fits the vast majority of TRV bodies"
    - "Frost protection setting prevents pipes freezing in unoccupied rooms"
  cons:
    - "No smart or app-based control — purely mechanical operation"
    - "Wax sensors can become sluggish with age and may need replacing after 10-15 years"
    - "Temperature markings are numbered rather than showing actual degrees"

## In-Depth Look

The Drayton TRV4 is one of those products that does its job so reliably that most people forget it is there. It has been the default TRV head for UK heating engineers for decades, and for good reason — it works, it lasts, and it fits almost everything.

### Wax Sensor Technology

Unlike liquid-filled or electronic TRV heads, the TRV4 uses a wax-filled sensor. The wax expands as the room warms and contracts as it cools, mechanically operating the valve pin to regulate water flow through the radiator. This approach is inherently reliable because there are no electronics, no batteries and no moving parts beyond the wax capsule and pin. The trade-off is that the response is slightly slower than liquid-filled sensors, but in practice the difference is negligible for domestic heating.

### Compatibility and Installation

The M30 x 1.5mm thread is the standard across the vast majority of TRV bodies sold in the UK, including those from Drayton, Honeywell, Pegler and many others. Installation is a simple push-and-screw operation — the head fits over the valve pin and the coupling nut tightens onto the valve body. Replacement takes less than a minute per radiator, making it a quick job to refresh all the TRV heads in a property during a boiler service.

### Verdict

The Drayton TRV4 remains the sensible default choice for thermostatic radiator valve heads in the UK. It is inexpensive, universally compatible and mechanically reliable. For those wanting smart control there are better options, but for straightforward, dependable room temperature regulation, the TRV4 continues to be the industry standard.
