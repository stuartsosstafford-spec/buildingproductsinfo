Ceiling water marks are the most common use case — those brown rings left by a historic leak that reappear stubbornly through every coat of emulsion. The aerosol format makes it easy to target individual stains without the need for brushes, trays, or cleanup, and the solvent-based formulation provides effective blocking power against water stains, tannin, nicotine, and light smoke damage."

    - "Strong solvent odour requires good ventilation during use"
    - "May need two coats over severe nicotine or heavy smoke staining"

## In-Depth Look

Stain bleed-through is one of the most frustrating problems in decorating. You paint over a water stain on the ceiling, it looks perfect while wet, and then as the paint dries the brown mark reappears. Polycell Stain Stop Aerosol is designed to break this cycle.

### How Stain Blocking Works

Water stains, tannin from wood, and nicotine deposits contain soluble compounds that dissolve in water-based paint and migrate to the surface as it dries. Standard emulsion simply cannot prevent this migration because the stain dissolves into the wet paint film. Stain Stop uses a solvent-based formulation that does not dissolve these water-soluble staining compounds, creating a barrier that locks the stain beneath the surface and prevents it from reaching the topcoat.

### The Aerosol Advantage

The spray format is the key practical benefit of this product. Rather than opening a tin of stain-blocking primer, pouring it into a tray, and cleaning brushes afterwards, you simply shake the can and spray directly onto the stain. For a single ceiling water mark — by far the most common use case — the aerosol format turns a messy job into a 30-second task. The product dries to a white matt finish within an hour and can be overcoated with standard emulsion.

### Verdict

Polycell Stain Stop Aerosol is a targeted problem-solver rather than a general-purpose primer. For spot-treating individual water stains, tannin bleed, or localised nicotine marks, the convenience of the aerosol format is unbeatable. For larger areas of staining, a tin of Zinsser B-I-N or Bulls Eye 1-2-3 will be more economical, but for the quick fix that most homeowners need, this product does the job efficiently.
