## In-Depth Look

Cloakrooms and small en-suites present a consistent challenge: how to provide a functional basin with storage in a space that barely fits a toilet. The Nuie Vault 400mm vanity unit is designed specifically for these spaces.

### Compact Dimensions

At 400mm wide and 222mm deep, the Vault occupies minimal floor space while still providing a usable basin and a storage cupboard. The slim depth means it does not project far from the wall, leaving walkway space in tight rooms.

### Soft-Close Door

The soft-close mechanism is a small detail that makes a noticeable difference. In a small room where the vanity door is opened and closed frequently, a slamming door is irritating. The soft-close prevents this while also protecting the unit from impact damage over time.

### Verdict

The Nuie Vault is the vanity unit that makes small bathrooms work properly. The basin and storage combination replaces a bare pedestal, the soft-close door adds quality, and the compact dimensions fit spaces where nothing else will.
