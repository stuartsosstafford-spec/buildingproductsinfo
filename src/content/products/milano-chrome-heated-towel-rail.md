## In-Depth Look

The heated towel rail has replaced the traditional bathroom radiator in most UK bathroom installations. It provides the same heating function while adding the practical benefit of warm, dry towels — something a flat panel radiator cannot offer.

### Central Heating Connection

This towel rail connects to the central heating system via standard 15mm pipework, just like a radiator. It is controlled by thermostatic radiator valves (TRVs) for individual room temperature control. For plumbers, installation is identical to fitting any radiator.

### Chrome Finish

Polished chrome remains the most popular finish for bathroom fixtures because it complements virtually every colour scheme and tile choice. The flat-bar design is the classic heated towel rail profile — practical for draping towels and visually clean.

### Verdict

The Milano chrome heated towel rail is the bathroom upgrade that adds both function and comfort. Warm towels after a shower are one of those small luxuries that homeowners notice and appreciate every day, and the dual heating function means no separate radiator is needed.
