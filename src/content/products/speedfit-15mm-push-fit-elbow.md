## In-Depth Look

Speedfit fittings changed the plumbing trade when they first appeared, and the 15mm equal elbow remains one of the most frequently used items in the range. Whether you are running pipework for a new bathroom or making a repair under the kitchen sink, these fittings make the job faster and cleaner than traditional soldered joints.

### How Push-Fit Works

The fitting uses a stainless steel grab ring (collet) that grips the pipe when it is inserted, combined with an EPDM O-ring that creates a watertight seal. The pipe needs to be pushed in fully to the internal pipe stop — Speedfit provides depth gauge marks on the pipe insert tool to help with this. Once inserted, the twist-and-lock collar is turned to prevent accidental release. To demount, you simply push the collet back and pull the pipe out.

### Reliability and Applications

Speedfit fittings are approved for use in both hot and cold water systems and central heating, with a maximum operating temperature of 95 degrees Celsius and pressure rating of 10 bar. They are WRAS approved for drinking water applications. The key to reliable performance is proper preparation — the pipe must be cut cleanly and squarely, deburred, and inserted to the correct depth. Failures are almost always down to poor preparation rather than the fitting itself.

### Verdict

The John Guest Speedfit 15mm equal elbow is a dependable and widely trusted fitting that makes plumbing work faster and more accessible. For professionals, it saves time on the job. For DIYers, it removes the barrier of needing soldering skills. A staple fitting that belongs in every plumber's van.
