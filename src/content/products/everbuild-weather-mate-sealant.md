## In-Depth Look

Everbuild Weather Mate has earned a solid reputation on UK building sites as a go-to exterior sealant for perimeter sealing and general weatherproofing. It fills the gap between standard decorators' caulk, which lacks weather resistance, and silicone sealants, which cannot be painted.

### Performance in Exterior Conditions

The permanently flexible formula is the main selling point. External joints are subject to constant thermal movement, and rigid fillers will crack within a season. Weather Mate accommodates this movement reliably, maintaining a watertight seal through freeze-thaw cycles and summer heat. The translucent finish means it does not stand out against different coloured substrates, and the ability to overpaint gives decorators full control over the final appearance.

### Application and Workability

The sealant guns out smoothly and tools off easily within its working time. It adheres well to timber, PVCu, brick, render, and most metals without the need for a primer. Surfaces should be clean and dry for best results, so planning application around the weather is important on exterior work. Cure time is dependent on temperature and joint depth, but the surface typically skins over within an hour.

### Verdict

Everbuild Weather Mate is a reliable, no-fuss exterior sealant that does exactly what it promises. Its combination of flexibility, paintability, and weather resistance makes it a strong choice for any tradesperson who needs a dependable gap filler for outside work. It will not replace silicone where waterproofing under immersion is required, but for general external sealing it is hard to fault at the price.
