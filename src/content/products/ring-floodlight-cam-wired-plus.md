## In-Depth Look

The Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Plus sits at the intersection of security lighting and smart home technology. It replaces a traditional passive infrared floodlight with a unit that not only illuminates but also records, communicates and alerts.

### Camera and Floodlights

The 1080p HD camera delivers clear footage day and night, with colour night vision providing useful detail after dark. The 140-degree field of view covers a wide area, and the two adjustable floodlight panels can be angled independently to direct the 2000 lumens where they are needed most. The combination of bright light and visible camera acts as a strong deterrent to intruders.

### Motion Detection and Alerts

The advanced motion detection system allows you to define custom motion zones through the Ring app, so you can focus detection on your driveway or front path while ignoring the public pavement beyond. When motion is detected, the floodlights activate, the camera begins recording, and a notification is sent to your phone. You can then view a live feed, speak through the two-way audio, or trigger the 105dB siren — all from the app.

### Installation Considerations

The Floodlight Cam Wired Plus is designed to be installed in place of an existing outdoor floodlight, using the same mounting point and mains supply. However, Part P of the Building Regulations in England and Wales classifies some outdoor electrical work as notifiable, so a qualified electrician is recommended for the installation. A strong Wi-Fi signal at the mounting location is essential for reliable video streaming.

### Verdict

The Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Plus is a well-integrated outdoor security solution that combines powerful floodlighting with smart camera capabilities. For homeowners who want motion-activated lighting, video recording and remote monitoring in a single hardwired unit, it is one of the most complete options on the market.
