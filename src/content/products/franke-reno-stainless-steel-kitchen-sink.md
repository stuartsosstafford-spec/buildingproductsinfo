## In-Depth Look

Stainless steel remains the most popular kitchen sink material in the UK, and Franke is one of the most recognised names in the category. The Reno 90 sits in the mid-range of their lineup, offering reliable Franke quality without the premium price of their designer models.

### Material and Construction

The 18/10 designation refers to the chromium and nickel content of the stainless steel (18% chromium, 10% nickel). This composition provides excellent corrosion resistance and a bright, easy-to-clean surface. The gauge of the steel gives the sink enough rigidity to resist flexing under use, while sound-dampening pads on the underside reduce noise from running water and washing up.

### Practical Design

The reversible drainer is a simple but valuable feature. During kitchen design, the sink orientation can be decided late in the process without affecting the product order. The single large bowl provides a generous washing area that accommodates items that would not fit in a divided bowl sink, making it the practical choice for households that regularly cook with large pots and baking trays.

### Verdict

The Franke Reno 90 is the sensible choice for kitchen installations where a reliable, good-quality stainless steel sink is needed without overspending. The reversible design and generous single bowl make it a versatile option that suits most UK kitchen layouts.
