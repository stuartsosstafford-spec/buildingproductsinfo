## In-Depth Look

A thermostatic shower mixer is the single biggest upgrade for shower comfort and safety. The Hansgrohe Ecostat 1001 CL delivers both, with a thermostatic cartridge that maintains water temperature within ±1°C regardless of pressure changes elsewhere in the system.

### Thermostatic Control

When someone runs a tap or flushes a toilet elsewhere in the house, the water pressure changes. A manual mixer responds with a sudden temperature change — potentially scalding. The Ecostat's thermostatic cartridge compensates automatically, maintaining the set temperature. This is both a comfort feature and a safety feature, particularly in homes with children or elderly users.

### SafetyStop

The 40°C SafetyStop is a mechanical limit that prevents the temperature control from being turned beyond 40°C without deliberately overriding the stop button. This is a Building Regulations requirement for new bathroom installations and a sensible safety feature for all households.

### Verdict

The Hansgrohe Ecostat 1001 CL is the thermostatic shower mixer that plumbers recommend when asked for quality. Its precise temperature control, SafetyStop, and Hansgrohe reliability make it the benchmark for exposed thermostatic bar valves.
