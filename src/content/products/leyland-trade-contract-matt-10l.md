## In-Depth Look

Not every painting project requires a premium emulsion. Leyland Trade Contract Matt exists for the projects where coverage area and budget are the dominant factors — new-build snag lists, rental property turnarounds, commercial spaces, and any situation where the walls need to look clean and freshly painted at the lowest possible cost.

### Coverage and Application

The coverage figure of up to 14 square metres per litre is achievable on smooth, previously painted surfaces, making a 10-litre tub capable of covering a significant area. On new plaster, the first coat should be thinned with water to act as a mist coat, followed by two full-strength coats. The paint has a thinner consistency than premium emulsions, which makes it easy to apply with brush and roller but means it builds opacity more gradually — two coats are always recommended for a solid finish.

### Finish Quality

The matt finish is clean and uniform, though it lacks the depth and richness of mid-range products. For rental properties, offices, and commercial spaces where the walls simply need to look presentable, this is perfectly adequate. The finish is not scrubbable, so in high-traffic areas where walls take regular contact, upgrading to a diamond matt or similar durable finish is advisable.

### Value Proposition

The real selling point is value. The cost per litre in a 10-litre tub is substantially lower than premium trade emulsions, and the coverage is good enough that the cost per square metre of finished wall is extremely competitive. For a landlord repainting a three-bedroom house between tenancies, the difference in total paint cost compared to a premium product is significant.

### Verdict

Leyland Trade Contract Matt Emulsion does exactly what it promises — it covers walls economically and provides a clean, fresh matt finish. It is not the most durable or the most luxurious emulsion available, but for budget-conscious projects where coverage and cost matter most, it remains one of the smartest choices in the UK trade paint market.
