## In-Depth Look

The Keter Oakland 757 represents the point at which resin sheds became a genuine alternative to timber. Earlier plastic sheds looked and felt cheap, but the Oakland's textured wood-effect panels, steel reinforcement and solid build quality make it a convincing replacement.

### Maintenance-Free

The single biggest advantage over timber is zero maintenance. No annual preservative treatment, no repainting, no replacing rotten panels. The resin construction is impervious to moisture, and the UV-protected finish does not fade or discolour over time. For homeowners who want storage without ongoing work, this is the primary selling point.

### Steel Reinforcement

The Oakland's steel-reinforced walls and roof provide structural rigidity that pure plastic sheds lack. Heavy items can be placed on shelving without the walls flexing, and the roof handles snow loading without concern.

### Verdict

The Keter Oakland 757 is the shed for people who never want to treat a shed again. Its maintenance-free construction, realistic appearance, and solid build quality make it the sensible long-term choice over timber sheds that need annual attention.
