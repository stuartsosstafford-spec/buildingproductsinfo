## In-Depth Look

Fence treatment is one of those maintenance tasks that most homeowners put off until the timber starts looking grey and weathered. Ronseal Fence Life Plus makes the job as painless as possible with a fast-drying, easy-to-apply formula that transforms tired fencing in a few hours.

### Application and Drying

The product applies well with a wide brush, a roller with a long-pile sleeve, or a pump sprayer. On rough-sawn fence panels — by far the most common substrate — a single generous coat is usually sufficient, though a second coat will improve both the colour depth and protection on very dry or porous timber. The 1-hour drying and rainproof time is a genuine advantage in the UK, where all-day dry weather cannot be relied upon. Being water-based, brushes and rollers clean up with warm soapy water, eliminating the need for white spirit.

### Colour and Protection

Fence Life Plus is available in a range of popular colours. The colour penetrates into the wood grain rather than sitting on top, giving a natural, translucent appearance that allows the timber texture to show through. UV protection helps maintain the colour, though some fading is inevitable on south-facing panels that receive intense sun exposure. The 5-year protection claim is achievable on sheltered fencing but may be optimistic on fully exposed, south-facing runs.

### Verdict

Ronseal Fence Life Plus delivers good results for minimum effort. Its quick-drying, water-based formula and competitive price per litre make it the practical choice for the annual fence-painting session. For the best results, apply on a dry day to clean, dry timber and do not skimp on the volume applied — a generous coat provides significantly better protection than a thin one.
