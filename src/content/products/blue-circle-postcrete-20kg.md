The post is solid and load-bearing within 10 minutes, allowing an entire fence run to be completed in a single day."

## In-Depth Look

Blue Circle Postcrete has simplified one of the most common garden maintenance tasks in the UK. Setting fence posts used to involve bags of cement, ballast, a wheelbarrow, and a good deal of physical effort. Postcrete reduces the process to pouring a dry powder and adding water.

### How It Works

The process is remarkably simple. Dig the post hole to the recommended depth (typically 600mm for a 1.8m fence post), position the post and check it is vertical, pour the dry Postcrete around the base to within 50mm of ground level, and then slowly add approximately 3 litres of water. The compound reacts with the water and begins to set almost immediately, reaching a firm, load-bearing state within 10 minutes. There is no mixing, no wheelbarrow, and no mess.

### Practical Considerations

A 20kg bag will set between 4 and 6 posts depending on the diameter of the hole. For a standard fence run with posts at 1.8-metre centres, one bag comfortably handles a reasonable number of posts. The product works in wet conditions — in fact, rain during or shortly after application does not compromise the set. For very large gate posts or posts bearing significant weight, it is worth using additional product to ensure a solid footing.

### Verdict

Blue Circle Postcrete is one of those products that makes you wonder how you ever managed without it. The cost premium over traditional concrete is easily justified by the time and effort saved, especially on domestic fencing projects where mixing concrete on-site is disproportionately laborious. For professional fencers and DIY homeowners alike, it has become an essential product.
