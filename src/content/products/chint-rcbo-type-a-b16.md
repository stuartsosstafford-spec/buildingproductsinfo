overview: "The Chint NB3LEU is a compact RCBO that combines overload, short circuit and earth leakage protection in a single-module-width device. The 16A Type B rating makes it suitable for ring finals, radial circuits and other general power applications, while the 30mA Type A RCD sensitivity detects both AC and pulsating DC earth faults. This Type A classification is increasingly specified in modern installations where electronic equipment can produce DC fault currents that a standard Type AC RCD would not detect."
whoItsFor:
  - "Electricians building Amendment 3 consumer units with individual circuit protection"
  - "Electrical contractors specifying Type A RCD protection for circuits supplying electronic equipment"
  - "Maintenance electricians replacing RCBOs in existing boards"
prosAndCons:
  pros:
    - "Individual circuit RCD protection eliminates cross-tripping between circuits"
    - "Type A sensitivity detects pulsating DC faults from electronic equipment"
    - "10kA breaking capacity suitable for virtually all domestic installations"
    - "Single module width saves valuable DIN rail space in the consumer unit"
  cons:
    - "Higher per-circuit cost compared to MCBs behind a shared RCD"
    - "Test button is small and can be difficult to press in a packed consumer unit"
    - "Less widely stocked at wholesalers than Schneider or Hager equivalents"

## In-Depth Look

RCBOs have become the preferred method of circuit protection in modern UK domestic installations. By combining the functions of an MCB and RCD into one device, each circuit gets its own independent earth leakage protection, which means a fault on one circuit does not trip others.

### Why Type A Matters

A standard Type AC RCD detects sinusoidal AC earth fault currents only. A Type A RCD detects both AC and pulsating DC fault currents. Modern electronic equipment — EV chargers, inverter-driven appliances, IT equipment — can produce DC components in a fault, which a Type AC device may not detect. Amendment 2 of BS 7671:2018 increasingly points towards Type A protection, and many specifiers now default to Type A RCBOs across the board.

### The 16A Sweet Spot

A 16A Type B RCBO is one of the most versatile ratings in the consumer unit. It protects ring final circuits (where the diversity of the ring is accounted for), radial circuits, and dedicated appliance circuits. Combined with 2.5mm2 cable, it covers the majority of socket outlet circuits in a domestic installation.

### Verdict

The Chint NB3LEU 16A RCBO offers genuine Type A protection in a single-module-width package, making it a space-efficient and technically sound choice for modern domestic consumer units. Its 10kA breaking capacity and competitive pricing make it a credible alternative to the bigger-name brands for electricians building fully RCBO-populated boards.
