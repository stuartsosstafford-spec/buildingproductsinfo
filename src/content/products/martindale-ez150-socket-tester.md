overview: "The Martindale EZ150 was the first socket tester to include earth loop impedance measurement, and it remains the benchmark for UK electricians. Its T-Safe technology ensures that RCDs will not trip during the loop impedance check — a common frustration with cheaper testers that cut power to entire circuits during testing."
whoItsFor:
  - "Electricians carrying out visual inspections and quick socket checks"
  - "Electrical inspectors performing EICR pre-checks"
  - "Landlords and property managers verifying socket safety between tenancies"
prosAndCons:
  pros:
    - "31 fault conditions detected — far more than basic socket testers"
    - "T-Safe non-trip technology avoids disrupting circuits during testing"
    - "Earth loop impedance gives meaningful safety data beyond simple pass/fail"
    - "No batteries required — powered from the socket under test"
  cons:
    - "Higher price than basic 3-LED socket testers"
    - "Not a substitute for full EICR testing with a multifunction tester"
    - "LED indication requires reference to the included chart for some faults"

## In-Depth Look

The Martindale EZ150 is the socket tester that serious electricians carry alongside their multifunction tester. It provides a fast first-look at socket condition without the setup time of a full loop impedance test.

### 31 Fault Conditions

Where basic socket testers check for three or four common wiring faults, the EZ150 detects 31 different conditions. This includes reversed polarity, missing earth, high earth impedance, and several fault combinations that cheaper testers simply cannot identify.

### T-Safe Non-Trip

The T-Safe technology is the EZ150's standout feature for working electricians. When performing the earth loop impedance check, the test current is kept below the trip threshold of RCDs, meaning you can test sockets on RCD-protected circuits without cutting power to the entire circuit. For electricians working in occupied homes and offices, this is invaluable.

### Verdict

The Martindale EZ150 is the professional socket tester that goes beyond basic pass/fail. Its 31-fault detection, earth loop impedance measurement, and T-Safe non-trip technology make it an essential tool for electricians who need quick, reliable socket checks without the disruption of tripped RCDs.
