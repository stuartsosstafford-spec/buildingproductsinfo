## In-Depth Look

Johnstone's One Coat Matt Emulsion occupies a useful middle ground in the UK paint market — it is a step above budget emulsions in quality while remaining significantly cheaper than premium trade lines. The "one coat" claim is the headline feature, and in practice it holds up well on most surfaces.

### Coverage and Opacity

The key selling point is the high titanium dioxide loading that gives this paint genuine hiding power. Over previously painted white or light-coloured surfaces, a single coat provides a clean, opaque finish. Over darker colours or bare plaster, a second coat is still advisable, but the first coat alone offers far better coverage than standard emulsions. The thicker consistency means each litre covers slightly less area — around 12 square metres — but the trade-off is that you are applying fewer coats overall.

### Application Experience

The paint comes out of the tin noticeably thicker than regular matt emulsion, which has both advantages and drawbacks. On the positive side, it loads well onto a roller and produces very little spatter, keeping floors and furniture cleaner during application. The downside is that cutting in with a brush requires a steady hand, as the thicker paint can leave visible brush marks if not worked out properly. For ceiling work, where spatter is the main concern, this formulation is particularly effective.

### Verdict

Johnstone's One Coat Matt Emulsion is a practical, well-priced paint that delivers on its core promise. It is best suited to maintenance repainting and quick refreshes rather than high-end decorating, and it particularly shines on ceilings where its low-spatter, high-opacity characteristics save both time and mess.
