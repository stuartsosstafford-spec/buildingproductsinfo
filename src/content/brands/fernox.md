## About Fernox

Fernox was founded in 1964 and has become a leading UK brand in central heating water treatment. The company develops and manufactures a comprehensive range of chemical treatments, magnetic filters, and system accessories designed to protect boilers, radiators, and pipework from corrosion, limescale, and sludge build-up, helping to maintain heating system efficiency and extend component life.

## Key Product Ranges

- **Inhibitors & Protectors**: Chemical treatments such as Fernox Protector F1 to prevent corrosion and limescale in central heating systems
- **Cleaners**: System cleaners and power flushes to remove sludge, debris, and magnetite from heating circuits
- **Magnetic Filters**: In-line magnetic filters including the TF1 range, designed to capture circulating debris before it reaches the boiler
- **Sealants & Leak Repair**: Leak sealers for minor system leaks without the need for a full drain-down

## Why Tradespeople Choose Fernox

Fernox is a staple brand for UK heating engineers, widely stocked at plumbing and heating merchants across the country. Boiler manufacturers frequently recommend Fernox products to comply with warranty conditions, and the brand's straightforward treatment programme — clean, protect, filter — gives installers a reliable and well-understood approach to system maintenance.
