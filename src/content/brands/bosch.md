## About Bosch

Bosch was founded in 1886 by Robert Bosch in Stuttgart, Germany, and has grown into one of the world's largest technology and engineering companies. The Bosch green-branded consumer and DIY line offers reliable power tools, garden equipment, and measuring instruments aimed at serious DIYers and light trade use, sitting alongside the blue Bosch Professional range for heavy-duty applications.

## Key Product Ranges

- **Power Tools**: Drills, jigsaws, sanders, and routers for DIY and light trade use
- **Garden Tools**: Lawnmowers, hedge trimmers, and leaf blowers across corded, cordless, and robotic platforms
- **Measuring Technology**: Laser levels, distance measurers, and detection tools
- **18V Power for All Alliance**: A shared cordless battery platform compatible across Bosch and partner brands

## Why Tradespeople Choose Bosch

Bosch has earned a reputation for engineering quality and reliability across its extensive product range. The brand's measuring tools in particular are widely trusted on UK job sites, while the 18V Power for All battery platform offers versatility for users who need tools across multiple categories without investing in separate battery ecosystems.
