## About Hilti

Hilti was founded in 1941 in Schaan, Liechtenstein, by Martin and Eugen Hilti. The company operates a unique direct sales model — Hilti tools are sold through Hilti account managers and the Hilti online store rather than through traditional trade counters. This model includes fleet management services where tools are maintained, repaired, and replaced on contract.

## Key Product Ranges

- **Chemical Anchors**: HIT-HY and HIT-RE injectable resin systems for structural fixing
- **Drilling & Demolition**: Rotary hammers, diamond coring, and breakers
- **Cordless Platform**: Nuron 22V battery system across 70+ tools
- **Direct Fastening**: Powder-actuated and gas-actuated fastening systems

## Why Tradespeople Choose Hilti

Hilti is the brand specified on commercial construction sites where performance and certification matter. The chemical anchor range is trusted for safety-critical structural fixings, the tools are built for continuous heavy-duty use, and the fleet management model means downtime is minimised. The direct relationship also provides technical support that general trade counter brands cannot match.
