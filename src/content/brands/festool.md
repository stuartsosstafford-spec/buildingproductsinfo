## About Festool

Festool was founded in 1925 in Esslingen, Germany, and has built a reputation for producing some of the finest power tools available. The company pioneered the portable circular saw and has consistently introduced innovations that have become industry standards, including integrated dust extraction and the Systainer storage system.

## Key Product Ranges

- **Dust Extraction**: CTM and CTL mobile dust extractors with automatic filter cleaning
- **Sanders**: ROTEX, ETS, and Granat abrasive systems for fine finishing
- **Track Saws**: TS series plunge saws with guide rail system
- **Systainer**: Modular tool and accessory storage that integrates across the range

## Why Tradespeople Choose Festool

Festool commands a price premium, but tradespeople who invest in the system consistently report that the precision, dust extraction integration, and build quality pay for themselves in time saved and finish quality. The Systainer storage system also means tools and accessories stay organised and protected on site.
